<p>Here’s the thing though – I couldn’t help but noticing that these 20mm googly eyes come in packs of <em>seventeen</em>. Joce charitably suggested that this was simply the number of eyes that could fit in the packet, but I am more cynical. Can it really be a coincidence that <em>eyes</em> – which are surely generally found in pairs – are sold in an odd quantity, forcing the purchaser to buy slightly more than they required?</p>
<p>And we’re not just looking at an odd number here – 17 is prime too, so even if you happened to be creating models of, say, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatara">the three-eyed Tuatara lizard</a>, you’re still going to end up with some product left over or feel obliged to buy another pack.</p>
<p>Cunning folk, these googly eye marketers, and it makes me wonder why other manufacturers stick to selling their products in multiples of integers with many divisors. Ease of packaging, perhaps.</p>
<p>What other products are sold in prime quantities?</p>
