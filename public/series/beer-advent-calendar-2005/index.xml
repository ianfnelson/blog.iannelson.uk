      <title>Beer Advent Calendar – Day Twenty-Four</title>

&lt;p&gt;Hertog Jan Doppio Double is the only one of my twenty-four Advent beers to come in a stone cork-stoppered bottle that weighs more than the drink contained within! At 7.3% ABV, it’s also the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/beer-advent-calendar-days-sixteen-and-seventeen/&#34;&gt;second-strongest&lt;/a&gt; drink in my selection, and hence has a real kick to it.That said, it also has a gorgeous malty aroma, and strong aftertaste which beer lovers will appreciate.So whilst it’s not quite my &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/beer-advent-calendar-day-six/&#34;&gt;personal favourite&lt;/a&gt; of the twenty-four beers I’ve had the pleasure of sampling this yuletide, it’s certainly an appropriately worthy and warming drink on which to finish.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Hertog Jan Doppio Double is the only one of my twenty-four Advent beers to come in a stone cork-stoppered bottle that weighs more than the drink contained within! At 7.3% ABV, it’s also the <a href="https://blog.iannelson.uk/beer-advent-calendar-days-sixteen-and-seventeen/">second-strongest</a> drink in my selection, and hence has a real kick to it.That said, it also has a gorgeous malty aroma, and strong aftertaste which beer lovers will appreciate.So whilst it’s not quite my <a href="https://blog.iannelson.uk/beer-advent-calendar-day-six/">personal favourite</a> of the twenty-four beers I’ve had the pleasure of sampling this yuletide, it’s certainly an appropriately worthy and warming drink on which to finish.</p>
<p>I’ve been asked to summarise my findings on these beers at the end of the season, and was considering publishing a spreadsheet noting my opinions in various categories (colour, aroma, aftertaste, strength, packaging, cute names…), but having consumed so many fine ales this month, it was beyond me to come up with such a complicated scoring system.Instead, I’ve made an effort to merely triage the beers according to my overall opinion and likelihood of repurchase – those with three stars will be on our shopping list in future, whilst those with one star will be avoided like the plague.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The penultimate beer on my 2005 advent calendar was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stpetersbrewery.co.uk/range/prod_detail.asp?CatID=1&amp;amp;Code=RUCASE&#34;&gt;Ruby Red&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stpetersbrewery.co.uk/&#34;&gt;St. Peter’s Brewery&lt;/a&gt; in Suffolk. I’d been looking forward to this 4.3% ABV red ale, which, like all of the beers from St. Peter’s, comes in a distinctive flask-shaped oval bottle, so I was somewhat disappointed by the intense bitterness of the first few mouthfuls. However, I think this was mostly due to the effects of the Mexican dinner laced with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.enconasauces.co.uk&#34;&gt;Encona sauces&lt;/a&gt; that I’d scoffed a few minutes previously. Further into the bottle, the “subtle malt undertones and spicy aroma” became more apparent, and overall I really enjoyed this beer – I’ll definitely be trying some of the others from the range.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fraoch.com/&#34;&gt;Fraoch&lt;/a&gt; is a 5% ABV Scottish beer that brings back many happy memories of late nights spent in the bar at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clachaig.com/&#34;&gt;Clachaig Inn&lt;/a&gt;. “Fraoch” is the Gaelic for heather, so take a guess what this beer is made from?  If you’ve never tried it, that might sound a bit weird, but believe me that this is a great beer with “a floral, peaty aroma, full malt body, spicy herbal flavour and a dry wine like finish”. What more could you ask for?  Slainte!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Jingle Knockers” isn’t exactly a phrase that inspires confidence, but this 5.5% ABV from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skinnersbrewery.com/&#34;&gt;Skinner’s Brewery&lt;/a&gt; in Cornwall is really good, definitely on a par with the stuff I’ve tried from Hambleton Ales and the Harviestoun Brewery. Smooth and strong, with subtle hints of Christmas pud – mmmm…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you’re still confused by that name, the label handily explains all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Known as the Tin Mine Fairies, the Cornish Knockers used to guide the miners to the rich veins of ore by knocking. With the demise of mining over the years, many knockers have ;returned to grass’ where, in disguise, they help with the brewing of their ales.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now, don’t get me wrong, there are many great things that have originated from America – not least of all my good lady wife – but I’ve always thought that “American Beer” is something of an anachronism!  Let’s face it, most beers from across the Altlantic are sorely lacking in flavour, body, bitterness, or, well, anything remotely beerlike. So, whilst on my search for twenty-four bottled beers for this advent calendar, I was intrigued to find Honker’s Ale from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gooseisland.com/&#34;&gt;Goose Island Beer Company&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago which describes itself as “a smooth, drinkable English bitter for those drinkers who want more from their beer”. Well, let’s hope they’re not looking for too much more, as it only comes in a 355ml bottle. It tastes OK when compared to the likes of Budweiser and Samuel Adams, but it’s not exactly bold or challenging, and the whole experience was over far too quickly. Not exactly one to savour on a cold winter’s night in Yorkshire, but I can imagine these going down quite well in the sports stadia of Iliinois.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Smuggler’s Ale is another bottled beer which found its way into my calendar via an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.asda-beer.co.uk/pages/competition.html&#34;&gt;Asda beer competition&lt;/a&gt;. It’s 5% ABV, with hints of treacle, and is really rather enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to paraphrase Forrest Gump, that’s all I have to say about that. Back to my beer and a DVD of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.familyguy.com&#34;&gt;Family Guy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s something a wee bit disappointing about picking up a bottle labelled “MOROCCO ALE” and finding that it is, in fact, from nowhere more distant than Harrogate – the Daleside Brewery to be precise. According to the label:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The recipe for Morocco Ale is believed to date from Elizabethan times. Colonel John Grahme of Levens was a courtier to James II and the name ‘Morocco’ may have been associated with the dark Moors who came to the court when Catherine of Braganza married Charles II and brought Tangiers as part of her dowry.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Right. Whatever. Apparently this 5.5% beer is brewed to an ancient secret recipe, so it’s curious that it tastes so strongly of rosemary. I mean, not just a little hint of the stuff, this really could conceivably be nothing more than fermented rosemary, the taste is so overwhelming. Which is certainly different, but I’m not sure it’s really my thing.</p>
<p>Six beers to go – wonder what tomorrow will bring?</p>

&lt;p&gt;Friday night saw me out celebrating in Halifax at our departmental Christmas meal (FWIW, I drank a few pints of Santa’s Little Helper from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.caledonian-brewery.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Caledonian brewery&lt;/a&gt;). As a result, I didn’t get chance to enjoy my advent beer, and have been playing catch-up with a couple of randomly-selected bottles tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the sixteenth beer to be selected from the vase of fate was Delirium Nocturnum, a &lt;strong&gt;9.0%&lt;/strong&gt; ABV dark ale from the Huyghe-Melle brewery in Belgium which comes in silver glittery 330ml bottles featuring pictures of pink elephants. I was somewhat apprehensive, but needlessly so, as this is a surprisingly well-balanced and hoppy triply-fermented ale – not a novelty drink at all (despite the packaging being somewhat reminiscent of a Pizza Express salad dressing bottle).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Secondly, today’s drink was Rolling Hitch, a 5.2% ABV India pale ale from the <a href="http://www.darwinbrewery.com">Darwin Brewery</a> in Sunderland. This was specially created for the purposes of entering (and winning) a competition to supply all Asda stores. It’s fruity, sharp, bitter and hoppy – very enjoyable.
Oh, and in case you were wondering,a quick <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22rolling&#43;hitch%22">Googling</a> reveals that a Rolling Hitch is a seafaring knot – <a href="http://www.apparent-wind.com/knots/rolling-hitch/"><em>“if a jib sheet jams in a winch, you can attach a rolling hitch to take the pressure off the line as you undo the jam”</em></a> – so now you know.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gadzooks!  Who would have thought that it would be so difficult to find a few minutes each day to transcribe a few words about a bottle of beer?  But it is – especially as we enter the party season and my evenings are filled with festivities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is, I have three excellent beers to report on; the first two of which are from breweries that I’ve already “visited” during this advent calendar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>The good news is, I have three excellent beers to report on; the first two of which are from breweries that I’ve already “visited” during this advent calendar.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s beer was Bitter &amp; Twisted, from the Harviestoun Brewery (c.f. <a href="https://blog.iannelson.uk/beer-advent-calendar-day-three/">Schiehallion</a> on day three). At 4.2% ABV it’s a little lighter than Schiehallion, but it’s equally delicious – very fresh, sharp and hoppy, it was voted Champion Bottled Ale 2004. Mmmmm.</p>
<p>Wednesday I came back closer to home for a second beer from the <a href="http://www.hambletonales.co.uk/">Hambleton Ales</a> microbrewery in Thirsk – this time it was Festive Filly (ABV 4.5%), which is presumably a seasonal ale, and damn nice it is too. Another good winter warming beer.</p>
<p>Finally, today I enjoyed Nessie’s Monster Mash, a 4.4% “premium beer” from the <a href="http://www.cairngormbrewery.com/">Cairngorm Brewery Company</a>. Very pleasant, plenty of flavour – I’d be interested in trying the cask version of this for comparison.</p>
<p>So there we have it, a trio of mighty fine ales from northern Britain, any one of which I’d love to have for a second time. Aaah, this beer advent calendar was *such* a good idea…</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Halfway through my great beer advent calendar 2005, and tonight I’ve enjoyed the popular Leffe Blonde, a potent and delicious 6.6% ABV beer from Belgium. I’ve been meaning to try this reknowned tipple since I utterly failed to identify a snippet of the label in one of those irritating Excel-based quizzes that circulates on the interweb periodically. Anyway, I wasn’t disappointed – the small bottle size (33cl) being more than made up for by the strength and the flavour (quite almondy, I thought). There’s a good detailed review by someone with more effective taste buds than I over at the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bottledbeer.co.uk/index.html?beerid=386&#34;&gt;Oxford Bottled Beer Database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just realised that I forgot to blog about yesterday’s advent beer. Sorry for keeping you all on tenterhooks like that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest I was a bit disappointed and couldn’t think of anything interesting to say about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.croptonbrewery.com/product.asp?cookiecheck=yes&amp;amp;P_ID=126&#34;&gt;Rudolph’s Revenge&lt;/a&gt;, a 4.6% ABV bitter from Cropton Brewery. It was quite similar to the equally uninspiring &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/beer-advent-calendar-day-eight/&#34;&gt;Mars Magic&lt;/a&gt; from last Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ah, I do enjoy beers by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wychwood.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Wychwood Brewery&lt;/a&gt;, who have a particularly good website (i.e. better than most of the brewery sites I’ve come across so far). Hobgoblin is an obvious favourite, easily available from any supermarket worth its salt. Today I sampled their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wychwood.co.uk/wychwood_whirlygig.htm&#34;&gt;Whirlygig&lt;/a&gt; ale, a 4.5% “frenzy of hops and malt”, which really is delicious. Lots of flavour, lots of character – very enjoyable indeed. This one goes into the “buy again” column. Jocelyn didn’t get a look in, so I can’t give you the female opinion, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bateman.co.uk/Beers/btroseynosey.htm&#34;&gt;Rosey Nosey&lt;/a&gt; by Bateman’s Brewery has a deceptively cutesy name, but it turns out to be a really decent-quality ale with plenty of flavour and a pleasing warmth. If you have to buy one festive-themed beer this year, you could do much worse than this one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another day, another beer.It’s a hard life.&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.woldtopbrewery.co.uk/products_3.htm&#34;&gt;Mars Magic&lt;/a&gt; is a rather unexciting 4.6% ABV “Premium Ale” (it says here) from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.woldtopbrewery.co.uk/index.htm&#34;&gt;Wold Top Brewery&lt;/a&gt;.Noticeably lacking in anything resembling a head, it did however seem to improve as I progressed through the half-litre (funny how that happens).So, with my whistle well and truly whetted, I’m off down &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yorkpubguide.com/pubs/details.asp?PubId=4&#34;&gt;the pub&lt;/a&gt;.Cya!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I nearly forgot to record Joce’s comments on the bitter.It went something like: “Eurgh!”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wednesday night’s tipple was the rather strange 5% ABV &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.k1664.co.uk&#34;&gt;Kronenbourg Blanc&lt;/a&gt;, from UK brewing giant &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A//www.scottish-newcastle.com/&#34;&gt;Scottish &amp;amp; Newcastle&lt;/a&gt;. Described as a “refreshing, fruity white beer”, this is in fact blatantly piss-coloured (which probably explains why it comes in an opaque bottle). I found this to be more reminiscent of a weak cider or some kind of bizarre citrus alcopop than anything deserving to have the word “beer” on the label. Still, try everything once except Morris Dancing and incest, as the saying goes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Jocelyn says: “This is a girly beer!  I could drink this!  This is fruity, it’s not a beer at all!”</p>
<p>Weird advertising, too – would you buy a drink for this girl?</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A return to form today, with the vase of fate serving up a helping of Riggwelter, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blacksheepbrewery.com/&#34;&gt;Black Sheep Brewery’s&lt;/a&gt; delicious 4.7% strong Yorkshire ale.I could drink this till the cows come home.Or perhaps that should be the sheep, for (according to the bottle) the name Riggwelter comes from the Old Norse &lt;em&gt;rygg&lt;/em&gt; meaning to overturn.“When a sheep is on its back and cannot get up without help, local dales dialect says it’s &lt;em&gt;rigged&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;riggwelted&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Jocelyn says: “That’s cheating, you’ve had that one before, you’re supposed to be trying something new.I’m not interested”.</p>
<p>She speaks the truth, this isn’t exactly my first Riggwelter.In fact I’ve taken Joce to visit the brewery in Masham before 🙂</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today’s festive ale is the Teignworthy Christmas Cracker, a strong (6% ABV) dark and warming malty bottle conditioned ale from deepest Devon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um, it’s OK, certainly tastes weighty and, well, worthy, but it isn’t really to my taste – it has a very strong aftertaste yet is lacking in any interesting fruity flavours.There are plenty of other things I’d rather drink before picking this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jocelyn says: “Damn, I’ve dripped it on my top, I’ll have to wash this now.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another superb ale tonight, and this one is close to home. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hambletonales.co.uk/nightmare.htm&#34;&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; by the Hambleton Ales microbrewery in Thirsk is an extremely creamy, fruity, and flavoursome stout—not as bitter as you might expect from its appearance. Very tasty—I’ll definitely be buying this again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third Time Lucky!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two days of novelty nonsense, the vase of fate finally served up a half-litre of Harviestoun Brewery’s 4.8% masterpiece, &lt;em&gt;Schiehallion&lt;/em&gt;, named after my all-time favourite &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munro&#34;&gt;Munro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an interesting fact for you: the mass of the Earth was first measured in 1774 when the Astronomer Royal, one Nevil Maskelyne, spent four months mucking about on Schiehallion with pendulums. By observing how the mountain’s bulk caused the pendulums (pendula?) to swing away from the vertical, he was able to estimate the mountain’s mass and extrapolate from this to calculate our planet’s mass at 5,000 million million tonnes—which is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=mass&amp;#43;of&amp;#43;earth&#34;&gt;pretty reasonable estimate&lt;/a&gt;, if you ask me. Based on that work, it then became possible to determine the mass of all the other planets, their moons, and even the Sun itself. All of which rather puts my own summer’s evening stroll up Schiehallion in 1998 into perspective, enjoyable though it was.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Oh, and the beer’s great too, by the way. Cask-conditioned, Bohemian style, lovely and refreshing, with a taste evocative of Scottish moorland and heather. It’s even won gold medals at CAMRA’s Great British Beer Festival.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, this evening’s advent beer couldn’t be more different from yesterday’s. I had the dubious pleasure of sampling &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chilibeer.com/&#34;&gt;Crazy Ed’s Cave Creek Chili Beer&lt;/a&gt;, all the way from Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be warned: the website dates from 1999, and boy, does it show—we’re talking Comic Sans in a scrolling &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;marquee&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, framesets that have a tendency to get confused (try clicking the “home” link), and a 53-kilopixel JPEG weighing in at an astonishing 232 KB (why?!). Seeing those “Netscape Now!” animated GIFs makes me all nostalgic for the twentieth century…&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, this evening’s advent beer couldn’t be more different from yesterday’s. I had the dubious pleasure of sampling <a href="http://www.chilibeer.com/">Crazy Ed’s Cave Creek Chili Beer</a>, all the way from Arizona.</p>
<p>Be warned: the website dates from 1999, and boy, does it show—we’re talking Comic Sans in a scrolling <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag, framesets that have a tendency to get confused (try clicking the “home” link), and a 53-kilopixel JPEG weighing in at an astonishing 232 KB (why?!). Seeing those “Netscape Now!” animated GIFs makes me all nostalgic for the twentieth century…</p>
<p><em>Ahem.</em> But enough about the site—what about the beer? Well, it was a lucky choice for this evening, as Joce had made Mexican for dinner. It was certainly spicy (with a whole chili pod in the bottle), but to be honest, I would have preferred a nice, refreshing Corona or Sol. As with yesterday’s offering, this was a fun novelty drink as a one-off, but not something I could happily sup all evening.</p>
<p>Joce says: “Oh! Ow! Oh my God! Oh, man! That is the hottest thing I’ve ever tasted! My throat is on fire!”</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is surely one of the best ideas I’ve ever had! I’ve followed through with my plan to buy twenty-four beers from around the world to count down the days until Christmas. Their names are all written on slips of folded paper in a small vase (nobody actually draws things out of a hat anymore, do they?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I’m enjoying &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youngsathome.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Young’s Christmas Pudding Ale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which is 5.5% ABV according to the bottle but only 5.0% according to the website—don’t believe everything you read on the web, eh?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Their names are all written on slips of folded paper in a small vase (nobody actually draws things out of a hat anymore, do they?).</p>
<p>Today I’m enjoying <strong><a href="http://www.youngsathome.co.uk/">Young’s Christmas Pudding Ale</a></strong>, which is 5.5% ABV according to the bottle but only 5.0% according to the website—don’t believe everything you read on the web, eh?</p>
<p>The tasting notes say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With its warming, dark ruby character and the splendid luscious flavour of dried fruit, Young’s Christmas Pudding Ale is an inspirational addition to any Christmas feast or fireside gathering.</p></blockquote>
<p>I say it’s tasty—pleasant as a singleton but probably a bit too fruity for a prolonged sesh. It really does smell like figgy pudding, too!</p>
<p>If this were a track on my iPod, I’d probably give it four stars.</p>
<p>Jocelyn says: “Huh? I can’t taste any fruit. Nope, tastes like beer to me. I’d prefer a Guinness.”</p>
<p>I wonder what tomorrow will bring…</p>
