&lt;p&gt;After an unprecedented &lt;em&gt;five years&lt;/em&gt; working the same gig, I will be available for shiny new contract roles from February 2023 &lt;em&gt;(edit: now April 2023, thanks to a short extension)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<p><img alt="Portrait image of a handsome software architect, standing outdoors and wearing a purple shirt" loading="lazy" src="https://blogstouks01.z33.web.core.windows.net/2023/08/IMG_0254-1.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="what-ive-been-doing-recently">What I’ve Been Doing Recently</h2>
<p>Since March 2018 I’ve been a Technical Lead for the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/">NHS App</a>, an England-wide way to access a range of NHS services via smartphone, tablet, and desktop web browser. It has been an amazing project to be a part of, and I’ve loved working in an open, collaborative, and agile delivery environment alongside a bunch of clever people from NHS Digital, Kainos, and BJSS.</p>
<p>I’ve led an ever-changing, multi-disciplinary team through over 120 fortnightly sprints — a period that saw the App’s user base grow from nothing to over thirty million users, and become the most downloaded app in the App Store during the COVID-19 pandemic years.</p>
<p>I’ve led the design and development of the App’s notification and messaging capability, which allows the secure and sub second delivery of health-related communications from NHS organisations to patient’s mobile devices, replacing more costly communication methods such as SMS or mail.</p>
<p>In case it’s not obvious, I’m pretty proud of what we’ve achieved on the NHS App over the past five years, and could write much more. But I’ll save that for a future blog post and return to the sales pitch…</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do-generally">What I Do Generally</h2>
<p>I am a hands-on Technical Architect / Technical Lead. I draw boxes and arrows on (real and virtual) whiteboards, and talk about those designs with teams, allowing us to collaboratively bring maintainable, performant and scalable solutions into existence.</p>
<p>I am detail-oriented and still a developer at heart. I like to stay close to the codebase. I am not an <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architecture-astronauts-scare-you/">Architecture Astronaut</a>. I prefer developing backend code to frontend. I am comfortable taking ownership of systems and communicating with people at all levels of an organisation.</p>
<h2 id="the-technology-i-use">The Technology I Use</h2>
<p>I have over 20 years’ experience of C# and .NET development, from the betas through to C#10 and .NET Core 6.0 (but I still have to occasionally Google how to properly implement the IDisposable pattern).</p>
<p>I have been working with Azure products for, gosh, it must be over a decade now. I have spent significant time wrangling with App Services, Function Apps, Cosmos DB (Mongo and (No)SQL), Event Hubs, SQL Database, Kubernetes Service and Service Bus. I have found and reported a bug to the Notification Hub product team, and been mailed a t-shirt by the Cognitive Search team in response to my feedback.</p>
<p>I favour distributed architectures that are loosely-connected by messaging patterns and RESTful APIs. I am vaguely suspicious of the rush towards Microservices. I am a bit disappointed that the end of the relational database hegemony means that I no longer get to use my SQL skills on a daily basis, but have replaced this with a new-found admiration for Splunk queries.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-work">How I Work</h2>
<p>I prefer to code in the open and work in the open. I favour public Slack channels over DMs. I appreciate the DevOps culture where all members of the team are empowered to make changes to a collective codebase. I think infrastructure as code is one of the game-changing trends of the last decade.</p>
<p>I still quite like Test-Driven Development, but am learning to be more pragmatic about when it is applied, and when to use chunkier integration tests.</p>
<p>I am a Microsoft Registered Partner, but do all my work on a MacBook.</p>
<p>I care very much about the quality of the solutions that I help to create, but I try to inject levity and humour into the working day, and do not take myself too seriously.</p>
<p>I like to break up lengthy blog posts with photos of my dog.</p>
<p><img alt="Sadie dog needs kibble. Please hire Ian. Woof!" loading="lazy" src="https://blogstouks01.z33.web.core.windows.net/2023/08/IMG_0221.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="more-randomness">More Randomness</h2>
<p>My favourite software books of all time include <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3XqhrLr">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZE8zDV">Domain-Driven Design</a>,</em> and <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3QzeaqW">Release It</a>!</em></p>
<p>My favourite GoF design patterns are Visitor and Chain of Responsibility.</p>
<p>Some people that I’ve worked with have written nice things about me, and I didn’t even have to pay them. You can read a collection of these endorsements on my <a href="https://blog.iannelson.uk/testimonials/">testimonials page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sound-good">Sound Good?</h2>
<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed reading these insights into my psyche and skills. If you’d like to know more, or think that I might be able to help you, then let’s talk. You can <a href="https://files.iannelson.uk/iannelson.pdf">download my CV here</a>, and email me at <a href="mailto:ian@iannelson.uk">ian@iannelson.uk</a>.</p>

      <title>Star Of The Week</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a lowly &lt;em&gt;sellsword&lt;/em&gt; amongst the ensemble cast that make up the incestuous York/Leeds IT scene, I am not usually one to be influenced by the promise of titles and honours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time was, long ago, in my first graduate job, that I yearned for a promotion from “Solution Developer” to “Development Specialist”. Now I give little consideration to what I’m called, and sell my services on the basis of what I can &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;, and the value I can bring to a project and an organisation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a lowly <em>sellsword</em> amongst the ensemble cast that make up the incestuous York/Leeds IT scene, I am not usually one to be influenced by the promise of titles and honours.</p>
<p>Time was, long ago, in my first graduate job, that I yearned for a promotion from “Solution Developer” to “Development Specialist”. Now I give little consideration to what I’m called, and sell my services on the basis of what I can <em>do</em>, and the value I can bring to a project and an organisation.</p>
<p>So, imagine my surprise when I recently returned to my desk at a client site to find the certificate below resting on my keyboard. It seems my highborn masters had seen fit to dub me (with tongue firmly in cheek, I presume), as their “Star of the Week”!</p>
<p><img alt="Star Of The Week Certificate" loading="lazy" src="https://blogstouks01.z33.web.core.windows.net/2023/08/StarOfTheWeek.jpg"></p>
<p>What had I done to deserve this honour?</p>
<p>The client had an existing solution to generate an XML feed summarising the information held within a database. Unfortunately this process was slow – it took around 45 seconds – and even though the output was aggressively cached, this was still causing a problem.</p>
<p>I actually enjoy occasionally tackling problems like this, where there is an existing solution that meets all functional requirements and my task is simply to improve some nonfunctional requirement – make it faster, make it more maintainable, make it scalable, update the technology stack, etc. The goal is much clearer when you have a reference solution to mimic than when starting with a blank page and having to tease out acceptance criteria from fickle humans!</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, some baseline profiling revealed that the problems lay in the data access layer, and with the help of Hibernating Rhino’s <a href="http://www.hibernatingrhinos.com/products/efprof">Entity Framework Profiler</a>, I was able to determine that over 35,000 separate database calls were being issued to create a file of a few megabytes.</p>
<p>This was possible because the data access was performed through a series of helper classes that wrapped the EF context and exposed mapped models. While this simplified the data access for most use cases, and helped to encapsulate low-level validation, it was a hindrance for any kind of aggregation or reporting requirement. Essentially the problem boiled down to the <em>SELECT N+1</em> problem on steroids, with a large portion of the object graph steadily loaded into memory.</p>
<p>Wrapping isn’t always a helpful approach…</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogstouks01.z33.web.core.windows.net/2023/08/iStock_000033567536Small.jpg"></p>
<p>The answer, having first defined some automated integration tests based on the existing solution, was to avoid using the helpful wrapper/mapper classes and instead write some bespoke EF queries against the underlying data context. I tried to strike a balance between making as few queries as possible without becoming unmaintainable or requiring too many joins. And each query, rather than returning the entire entity, instead projected only the required properties into some anonymous types. A little in-memory post-processing then turned these projections into the desired output format.</p>
<p>The end result? A process that originally made over 35,000 database queries and took 45 seconds was reduced to one that required just 7 queries and completed in around 0.45 seconds. Nice.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post comes to you live from a Starbucks in the north of England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wrapped up another eight months’ stint contracting at my old haunt &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marshalls.com/&#34;&gt;Marshalls Plc&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been a genuinely interesting gig, working on two distinct greenfield projects using bang up to date technologies including .NET 4.0 and MVC2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it hasn’t just been a benefit for my CV, I think Marshalls might have got a little something out of the arrangement too, as Marshalls’ Development Manager Sion Harrison commented yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>But it hasn’t just been a benefit for my CV, I think Marshalls might have got a little something out of the arrangement too, as Marshalls’ Development Manager Sion Harrison commented yesterday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You have enabled us to drive some major changes into the business whilst introducing new technologies and concepts to the team. We now have great working examples of Workflow, NHibernate, IOC, programming to interfaces and MVC code which can be applied in other applications. I couldn’t have asked for more – a combination of business and technological advancement. Thanks again.”</p></blockquote>

To my mind they always look a bit facile, glib and superficial. “Destiny” equates to a holiday villa on the Maldives?  “Integrity” is a Lion? “Success” appears to involve hang-gliding off towards the ocean in an action which brings to mind Reginald Perrin?!

<p>“Shake off your doubts and then go for it.<br>
Check out your options and act.<br>
Find an approach to the future,<br>
And turn today’s dreams into fact.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve seen those words on a daily basis for far too long. Today is the day that I stop simply reading them, and start acting upon them.</p>
<p>After much deliberation, I’ve handed in my notice at Marshalls and begun setting myself up as a contractor. I have been mulling over the idea of going freelance for a long time, but have always had other distractions to worry about. Now that I’m married, settled in a new house, have obtained UK residency for Jocelyn, and baby Ben is settling down nicely, I figure that my life is finally getting to be stable and prosaic, and I should take this opportunity to stir things up a bit by handing in my notice with no certainty of regular (or indeed any) future income!</p>
<p>I am filled with a heady mixture of trepidation and excitement. More details will, undoubtedly, appear on this blog in due course. Wish me luck!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am now a Microsoft Certified Solution Developer in .NET 1.x technologies. This is a qualification that I’ve been working towards on and (more often than not) off for the past four years or so. It’s not really the case that the exams were super-hard, just that it took occasional motivation to get round to taking them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, was it worth it?  Did I learn anything en route?  Did the exams boost my employability?  Would I be more inclined to employ someone with an MCSD than an applicant without?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am now a Microsoft Certified Solution Developer in .NET 1.x technologies. This is a qualification that I’ve been working towards on and (more often than not) off for the past four years or so. It’s not really the case that the exams were super-hard, just that it took occasional motivation to get round to taking them!</p>
<p>So, was it worth it?  Did I learn anything en route?  Did the exams boost my employability?  Would I be more inclined to employ someone with an MCSD than an applicant without?</p>
<p>Stepping back in time a little, my first real conversation about .Net was in November 2000, at a job interview for a position with <a href="http://www.ioko.com">ioko</a> (then Infocom), when <a href="http://www.farend.co.uk/">Matthew</a> asked me something vague along the lines of “what did I understand regarding Microsoft’s .NET initiative?”  I honestly can’t remember my answer, but it can’t have utterly sucked as I got the job, and started the following month.</p>
<p>A year later, December 2001, and I attended the two-day .NET launch at the London Hilton, at which a certain Bill Gates gave a keynote speech explaining why .NET was the future. It was one of the few sessions at that conference which didn’t go over my head – the rest utterly blew my mind, and made me feel extremely ignorant – me with my VB6 and ASP3 skills!</p>
<p>Another year passed, and a quiet market meant that I still hadn’t had any opportunity to cut my teeth on any .NET projects. But crucially (and in retrospect foolishly), I also hadn’t put any personal effort into learning these important new technologies. So, on 3rd December 2002, I ordered some self-study books for exams 70-315 and 70-316. Apparently expecting to learn by osmosis, I then popped them on my bookshelf, and headed off to Australia to visit my friends Bruce and Suzanne.</p>
<p>When I got back from Down Under, in January 2003, my job at ioko was not waiting for me. That quiet market wasn’t getting any noisier, a cull had to occur, and, since I didn’t have any proven .Net skills…</p>
<p>Redundancy wasn’t a pleasant experience, and I wanted to get back into the world of work ASAP (after all, the mortgage wasn’t going to pay itself), so I quickly took up what I always expected to be a stop-gap VB6/ASP job – the pay wasn’t great but it beat daytime TV, spamming the employment agencies and constantly refreshing jobserve.com. It was at this point in time I realised that the only person with the capability to improve my skills and career prospects was myself. For too long I had equated career success to “luck” in being placed on the right projects. Now it was time for me to invest some time and energy learning those all-important .NET skills that I’d been reading about for the past few years.</p>
<p>For much of the long hot summer of 2003, I burnt the midnight oil developing a three-tier web application for the investment club of which I was the treasurer at that time. This served a number of purposes:  Of course, the website was useful to those who had access to it, but more importantly to me, it provided a way to develop the .NET skills that I saw as being the keys to a better job. Now, the obvious shortcoming of using a personal project as a way to learn a set of technologies is that you’re unlikely to stumble across those enterprise-y features in the Framework that are of particular use in business scenarios. So, I supplemented my late-night hacking sessions (which incidentally resulted in my neighbours complaining about my playing pop music at 2am) with some diligent studying of the 70-306 guide that I’d bought the previous winter. On 14th June 2003, after spending around £80 of my own cash to take the exam, I passed that test, becoming an MCP for the first time.</p>
<p>Was it worth it?  I think so. My efforts meant I got a good grounding in aspects of the technologies that I would not otherwise have stumbled across, and it gave me something concrete and .NET-related to put on my CV (effectively saying “yeah, I know I haven’t worked with these technologies professionally, but that doesn’t mean I don’t understand them”). A few months later, as the market started to gradually pick up again, I got the job I still have – as a .NET developer for Marshalls. I’ve no doubt that the MCP exam helped to at least get my foot in the door.</p>
<p>I took the remaining four exams at my leisure over the next few years. Whilst studying for the SQL Server (70-229), Web Services and Server Components (70-320) and Requirements and Architectures (70-300) exams, I always found myself learning several things that I hadn’t picked up on the job – in that sense at least, I think undertaking the exams was worthwhile. The final exam I took was the Windows App exam (70-316), and this was a bit of a stroll in all honesty, after the previous four exams and three year’s of .NET experience.</p>
<p>Would I be more inclined to employ someone with an MCSD than an applicant without?  I think the qualification helps greatly in identifying potential candidates, but there are many other factors that make a good developer that aren’t covered in any depth by these exams. Design Patterns and OOP concepts in general were not really tested, even on the 70-300 exam. Knowledge of IIS was not covered on 70-306 – I guess it’s assumed that this is the realm of the Systems Administrator rather than the coder, but in reality (especially in small teams), a good ASP.NET developer needs an intimate understanding of how their web server works and is configured. What about covering topics such as source control, automated builds, and release management?  Issues such as unit testing and the benefits of code reviews were mentioned in the 70-300 exam, but there’s a difference between knowing the theory and applying this in practice. An MCSD qualification certainly demonstrates the former, but a few searching questions at interview are still required to prove the latter.</p>
<p>So what’s next for me?  Upgrading to the “<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/developer/eadev.mspx">MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer</a>” qualification is the obvious path, and I’ll probably do so in due course, but right now I’d like to like to spend more time getting to grips with SQL Server 2005 by taking the relevant <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/sql/default.mspx">MCTS exam (70-431)</a>. If that goes well, then maybe I’ll continue onto the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcitp/dbdev/default.mspx">MCITP: DB Dev</a> qualification. We’ll see.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Keogh has been blogging her &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.livejournal.com/users/sirenian/19432.html&#34;&gt;advice for software-developer apprentices&lt;/a&gt;, and recommends buying and reading a selection of good software development books. I think this is sound advice – personally I felt that my career and abilities starting taking off when I stopped reading tech-specific Wrox tomes that were obsolete within six months of publication and started buying timeless Addison-Wesley hardbacks. Why so many newbie coders insist on rediscovering solutions to well-known problems instead of leveraging the knowledge of our programming forebears is beyond me, but most of us have behaved in this way at some point. Give yourself a leg-up and read some decent software design books.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Give yourself a leg-up and read some decent software design books.</p>
<p>If I had to make a list, the books I would currently prescribe for new graduates entering a career of enterprise OO development would be:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735619670"><em>Code Complete</em></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321125215"><em>Domain Driven Design</em></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201485672"><em>Refactoring</em></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201633612"><em>Design Patterns</em></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321127420"><em>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</em></a></li>
</ol>
<p>and if I was feeling cynical I’d perhaps also advise a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590590082"><em>The Career Programmer – Guerilla Tactics for an Imperfect World</em></a> be kept stashed in a laptop bag…</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A major project I’ve been working on for the last ten months has just gone live, giving me some time recently to take stock, do a bit of R&amp;amp;D, and catch up on some reading. I’ve been reflecting on how to approach things better in the future, and to this end, I’ve just finished two very different books about the software development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’Reilly’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596004850&#34;&gt;Extreme Programming Pocket Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a handy little summary of the approach (only 81 pages), depicting a near-utopian development shop where everyone is happy, and projects come in under budget and on time. It got me quite fired up, actually, and some of the concepts described are interesting. But deep down, I just know this would never happen in the real world—too much politics, too many personalities at play in the workplace, in my humble opinion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>This is where the second book I read this week comes in. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590590082">The Career Programmer: Guerrilla Tactics for an Imperfect World</a></em> provides useful suggestions for dealing with the aforementioned politics and personalities in pursuit of spending more time happily coding while developing your skills and career.</p>
<p>Both books are well worth reading for any professional coder, as together they offer a wealth of practical advice on making a developer’s life less stressful.</p>
