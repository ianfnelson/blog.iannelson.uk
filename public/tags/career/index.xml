      <description>&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Keogh has been blogging her &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.livejournal.com/users/sirenian/19432.html&#34;&gt;advice for software-developer apprentices&lt;/a&gt;, and recommends buying and reading a selection of good software development books. I think this is sound advice – personally I felt that my career and abilities starting taking off when I stopped reading tech-specific Wrox tomes that were obsolete within six months of publication and started buying timeless Addison-Wesley hardbacks. Why so many newbie coders insist on rediscovering solutions to well-known problems instead of leveraging the knowledge of our programming forebears is beyond me, but most of us have behaved in this way at some point. Give yourself a leg-up and read some decent software design books.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I think this is sound advice – personally I felt that my career and abilities starting taking off when I stopped reading tech-specific Wrox tomes that were obsolete within six months of publication and started buying timeless Addison-Wesley hardbacks. Why so many newbie coders insist on rediscovering solutions to well-known problems instead of leveraging the knowledge of our programming forebears is beyond me, but most of us have behaved in this way at some point. Give yourself a leg-up and read some decent software design books.</p>
<p>If I had to make a list, the books I would currently prescribe for new graduates entering a career of enterprise OO development would be:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735619670"><em>Code Complete</em></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321125215"><em>Domain Driven Design</em></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201485672"><em>Refactoring</em></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201633612"><em>Design Patterns</em></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321127420"><em>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</em></a></li>
</ol>
<p>and if I was feeling cynical I’d perhaps also advise a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590590082"><em>The Career Programmer – Guerilla Tactics for an Imperfect World</em></a> be kept stashed in a laptop bag…</p>

      <title>Ideal World / Real World</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A major project I’ve been working on for the last ten months has just gone live, giving me some time recently to take stock, do a bit of R&amp;amp;D, and catch up on some reading. I’ve been reflecting on how to approach things better in the future, and to this end, I’ve just finished two very different books about the software development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’Reilly’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596004850&#34;&gt;Extreme Programming Pocket Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a handy little summary of the approach (only 81 pages), depicting a near-utopian development shop where everyone is happy, and projects come in under budget and on time. It got me quite fired up, actually, and some of the concepts described are interesting. But deep down, I just know this would never happen in the real world—too much politics, too many personalities at play in the workplace, in my humble opinion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>O’Reilly’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596004850">Extreme Programming Pocket Guide</a></em> is a handy little summary of the approach (only 81 pages), depicting a near-utopian development shop where everyone is happy, and projects come in under budget and on time. It got me quite fired up, actually, and some of the concepts described are interesting. But deep down, I just know this would never happen in the real world—too much politics, too many personalities at play in the workplace, in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>This is where the second book I read this week comes in. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590590082">The Career Programmer: Guerrilla Tactics for an Imperfect World</a></em> provides useful suggestions for dealing with the aforementioned politics and personalities in pursuit of spending more time happily coding while developing your skills and career.</p>
<p>Both books are well worth reading for any professional coder, as together they offer a wealth of practical advice on making a developer’s life less stressful.</p>
