      <title>Zero Interest Bug Arrives</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, base rates are now down to 1.0%, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/zero-interest-bug/&#34;&gt;Zero Interest Bug&lt;/a&gt; is not just conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/property_and_mortgages/article5668432.ece&#34;&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“About 1,500 customers who took out a tracker mortgages pegged at 1.01 points below the base rate with Cheltenham &amp;amp; Gloucester (C&amp;amp;G), owned by Lloyds Banking Group, will be paying no interest at all on their home loans from next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the first time that a mortgage lender has been forced to reduce the interest on their home loans to zero.
Lloyds Banking Group, now 43 per cent owned by the taxpayer and also the owner of C&amp;amp;G, said that there was a zero floor to the deal and that &lt;strong&gt;because its computer systems could not cope with zero&lt;/strong&gt;, it would be temporarily charging 0.001 per cent, or 8p a month for a borrower with a £100,000 mortgage. However, that money will be refunded.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>From <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/property_and_mortgages/article5668432.ece">The Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote>

However, that money will be refunded.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I bet those jammy 1,500 people are feeling quite smug today. Needless to say, I’m still kicking myself very hard for fixing my mortgage last summer… sob!</p>

      <title>Zero Interest Bug</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started my career in professional software development a decade or so ago by testing and fixing banking code that had fallen victim to the millennium bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could the prospect of zero percent interest rates create a similar boom in demand for software developers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.contractoruk.com/004128.html&#34;&gt;Contractor UK&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest rates have plummeted from 5% to 2% since early October and are heading lower. Some analysts say 0% is not out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Imagine all the policy bounds checkers and field validation routines that need modifying to handle zero percent interest rates. The entire insurance industry will be clambering to find COBOL programmers able to understand 30 year old code and everybody else will benefit as demand escalates.</p></blockquote>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Never underestimate the stupidity of users—or the benefits of a little field validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the web-based systems I’ve been developing allows users to enter a customer’s fax number and automatically fax confirmation details (using Zetafax). It’s been working pretty well—until we discovered a flaw today. One user, tired of obtaining valid fax details from customers, had been entering a string of nines and then actually attempting to send the fax to this number.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>We first learned of this issue today, when West Yorkshire Police asked us to stop trying to send faxes to the emergency services!</p>
