      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Twelve Apostles, before Sunday&amp;rsquo;s collapse&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://blogstouks01.z33.web.core.windows.net/2023/08/twelve-apostles_13454971_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy cow, one of the limestone towers at Australia’s Twelve Apostles park has collapsed into the sea!  It was the one in the foreground of the photo to the left. Seeing this fantastic set of rock formations (and flying over them in a helicopter) was one of the many highlights of my vacation to Australia in Dec 2002 / Jan 2003. You always hear about coastal erosion and the way landscape changes over time, but never really expect significant changes to occur during your own lifetime&lt;/p&gt;</description>
