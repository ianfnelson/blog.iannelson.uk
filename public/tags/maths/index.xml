      <title>Spot The Misleading Graph</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fifty-three years since Darrell Huff published the seminal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0140136290?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=ianesbl-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0140136290&#34;&gt;How to Lie with Statistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and still we have newspapers as august as &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt; pulling the oldest trick in the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://blogstouks01.z33.web.core.windows.net/2023/08/times.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance it all looks very impressive, but closer inspection of the comparison with sales of the Torygraph reveal a mere 8.7% sales lead, not more than double as suggested by the graphic.Not fooled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another favourite book of mine that covers the still-relevant topic of graphical integrity is Edward Tufte’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0961392142?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=ianesbl-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0961392142&#34;&gt;The Visual Display of Quantitative Information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. It’s one of those timeless works that I look forward to sharing with the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Big Integer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/project-euler/&#34;&gt;last summer&lt;/a&gt;, I do enjoy whiling away a few hours attempting to solve the maths / progamming challenges set on &lt;a href=&#34;http://mathschallenge.net/index.php?section=project&#34;&gt;Project Euler&lt;/a&gt;. My language of choice for most puzzles is C#, but this hampered me on some of the questions as there is no in-built support for really big integers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a little bit of Googling and I came across this excellent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/biginteger.asp&#34;&gt;BigInteger class&lt;/a&gt; on Code Project which does everything I need and more – and it seems bloody fast, too. Thanks to this class, I’ve been able to knock off several more problems this weekend, and now have a rating of “11% Genius” – still some way to go, then…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rounding Up The Result of Integer Division</title>
      <link>https://blog.iannelson.uk/rounding-up-the-result-of-integer-division/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2005 11:09:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a damn useful piece of information which should be in the armoury of every modern codemonkey:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Java, if it is required to round up the result of dividing &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; (where &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; are integers), one should compute &lt;code&gt;(m+n-1)/n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/%7Ercb/G51MPC/slides/NumberLogic.pdf&#34;&gt;Number Conversion, Roland Backhouse, 2001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve used this deliciously elegant result in production J2EE code in the past, but it’s equally valid in C#, &lt;em&gt;as long as you can make the additional assertion that m/n is positive&lt;/em&gt;. This is because whilst Java treats integer division by rounding to zero, &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/6a71f45d%28en-us,vs.80%29.aspx&#34;&gt;C# merely truncates the result&lt;/a&gt; (in an unchecked context). In my experience, the most frequentuse for this result is the deft answering of questions such as “if I have x items in my dataset and I display y per page, how many pages do I have in total?”, where it is obviously safe to make the assertion of a positive result.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
