      <title>Inheriting From BaseValidator to Make Custom Validation Controls</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For months now, I’ve been desperate for a decent excuse to make a custom ASP.NET server control, so I was secretly pleased today when a CustomValidator originally coded for use on a single page was required elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s surprisingly easy to do, although it took me a while to find a decent example online, which eventually came courtesy of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/webtech/tips/t040302-1.shtml&#34;&gt;4GuysFromRolla&lt;/a&gt;. In my particular scenario, I needed to check that the text entered into a TextBox did not equal any of a selection of &amp;ldquo;banned&amp;rdquo; strings (which was available via a static property on another class).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>It’s surprisingly easy to do, although it took me a while to find a decent example online, which eventually came courtesy of the <a href="http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/webtech/tips/t040302-1.shtml">4GuysFromRolla</a>. In my particular scenario, I needed to check that the text entered into a TextBox did not equal any of a selection of &ldquo;banned&rdquo; strings (which was available via a static property on another class).</p>
<p>Having added a new custom web control, deriving from BaseValidator, my first task was therefore to ensure that the control being validated really was a TextBox – this was done by overriding the <code>ControlPropertiesValid()</code> method:</p>



  

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ianfnelson/9842442.js?file=ControlPropertiesValid.cs"></script>
<p>That done, I just had to override the <code>EvaluateIsValid()</code> method, which does the actual validation:</p>



  

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ianfnelson/9842442.js?file=EvaluateIsValid.cs"></script>
<p>&hellip;and that was it. Job done, pretty much. OK, so I spent a while making a cute icon image too. But the coding was easy and straightforward – inheriting from BaseValidator meant that most of the work was already done for me. In no time at all I was able to drop this custom control onto the required pages and user controls.</p>
