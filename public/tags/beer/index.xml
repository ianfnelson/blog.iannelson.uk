      <title>Beer Advent Calendar – Day Eight</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another day, another beer.  It’s a hard life.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.woldtopbrewery.co.uk/products_3.htm&#34;&gt;Mars Magic&lt;/a&gt; is a rather unexciting 4.6% ABV “Premium Ale” (it says here) from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.woldtopbrewery.co.uk/index.htm&#34;&gt;Wold Top Brewery&lt;/a&gt;.  Noticeably lacking in anything resembling a head, it did however seem to improve as I progressed through the half-litre (funny how that happens).  So, with my whistle well and truly whetted, I’m off down &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yorkpubguide.com/pubs/details.asp?PubId=4&#34;&gt;the pub&lt;/a&gt;.  Cya!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I nearly forgot to record Joce’s comments on the bitter.  It went something like: “Eurgh!”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beer Advent Calendar – Day Six</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A return to form today, with the vase of fate serving up a helping of Riggwelter, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blacksheepbrewery.com/&#34;&gt;Black Sheep Brewery’s&lt;/a&gt; delicious 4.7% strong Yorkshire ale.  I could drink this till the cows come home.  Or perhaps that should be the sheep, for (according to the bottle) the name Riggwelter comes from the Old Norse &lt;em&gt;rygg&lt;/em&gt; meaning to overturn.  “When a sheep is on its back and cannot get up without help, local dales dialect says it’s &lt;em&gt;rigged&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;riggwelted&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Jocelyn says: “That’s cheating, you’ve had that one before, you’re supposed to be trying something new.  I’m not interested”.</p>
<p>She speaks the truth, this isn’t exactly my first Riggwelter.  In fact I’ve taken Joce to visit the brewery in Masham before 🙂</p>

      <title>Beer Advent Calendar – Day Five</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today’s festive ale is the Teignworthy Christmas Cracker, a strong (6% ABV) dark and warming malty bottle conditioned ale from deepest Devon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um, it’s OK, certainly tastes weighty and, well, worthy, but it isn’t really to my taste – it has a very strong aftertaste yet is lacking in any interesting fruity flavours.  There are plenty of other things I’d rather drink before picking this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jocelyn says: “Damn, I’ve dripped it on my top, I’ll have to wash this now.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another superb ale tonight, and this one is close to home. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Nightmare&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; by the Hambleton Ales microbrewery in Thirsk is an extremely creamy, fruity, and flavoursome stout—not as bitter as you might expect from its appearance. Very tasty—I’ll definitely be buying this again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beer Advent Calendar – Day Three</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third Time Lucky!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two days of novelty nonsense, the vase of fate finally served up a half-litre of Harviestoun Brewery’s 4.8% masterpiece, &lt;em&gt;Schiehallion&lt;/em&gt;, named after my all-time favourite &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munro&#34;&gt;Munro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an interesting fact for you: the mass of the Earth was first measured in 1774 when the Astronomer Royal, one Nevil Maskelyne, spent four months mucking about on Schiehallion with pendulums. By observing how the mountain’s bulk caused the pendulums (pendula?) to swing away from the vertical, he was able to estimate the mountain’s mass and extrapolate from this to calculate our planet’s mass at 5,000 million million tonnes—which is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=mass&amp;#43;of&amp;#43;earth&#34;&gt;pretty reasonable estimate&lt;/a&gt;, if you ask me. Based on that work, it then became possible to determine the mass of all the other planets, their moons, and even the Sun itself. All of which rather puts my own summer’s evening stroll up Schiehallion in 1998 into perspective, enjoyable though it was.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Oh, and the beer’s great too, by the way. Cask-conditioned, Bohemian style, lovely and refreshing, with a taste evocative of Scottish moorland and heather. It’s even won gold medals at CAMRA’s Great British Beer Festival.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, this evening’s advent beer couldn’t be more different from yesterday’s. I had the dubious pleasure of sampling &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Crazy Ed’s Cave Creek Chili Beer,&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; all the way from Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be warned: the website dates from 1999, and boy, does it show—we’re talking Comic Sans in a scrolling &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; tag, framesets that have a tendency to get confused (try clicking the “home” link), and a 53-kilopixel JPEG weighing in at an astonishing 232 KB (why?!). Seeing those “Netscape Now!” animated GIFs makes me all nostalgic for the twentieth century…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p><em>Ahem.</em> But enough about the site—what about the beer? Well, it was a lucky choice for this evening, as Joce had made Mexican for dinner. It was certainly spicy (with a whole chili pod in the bottle), but to be honest, I would have preferred a nice, refreshing Corona or Sol. As with yesterday’s offering, this was a fun novelty drink as a one-off, but not something I could happily sup all evening.</p>
<p>Joce says: “Oh! Ow! Oh my God! Oh, man! That is the hottest thing I’ve ever tasted! My throat is on fire!”</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is surely one of the best ideas I’ve ever had! I’ve followed through with my plan to buy twenty-four beers from around the world to count down the days until Christmas. Their names are all written on slips of folded paper in a small vase (nobody actually draws things out of a hat anymore, do they?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I’m enjoying &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youngsathome.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Young’s Christmas Pudding Ale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which is 5.5% ABV according to the bottle but only 5.0% according to the website—don’t believe everything you read on the web, eh?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I’ve followed through with my plan to buy twenty-four beers from around the world to count down the days until Christmas. Their names are all written on slips of folded paper in a small vase (nobody actually draws things out of a hat anymore, do they?).</p>
<p>Today I’m enjoying <strong><a href="http://www.youngsathome.co.uk/">Young’s Christmas Pudding Ale</a></strong>, which is 5.5% ABV according to the bottle but only 5.0% according to the website—don’t believe everything you read on the web, eh?</p>
<p>The tasting notes say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With its warming, dark ruby character and the splendid luscious flavour of dried fruit, Young’s Christmas Pudding Ale is an inspirational addition to any Christmas feast or fireside gathering.</p></blockquote>
<p>I say it’s tasty—pleasant as a singleton but probably a bit too fruity for a prolonged sesh. It really does smell like figgy pudding, too!</p>
<p>If this were a track on my iPod, I’d probably give it four stars.</p>
<p>Jocelyn says: “Huh? I can’t taste any fruit. Nope, tastes like beer to me. I’d prefer a Guinness.”</p>
<p>I wonder what tomorrow will bring…</p>
