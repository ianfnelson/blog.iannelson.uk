    <p>I first wandered up the long track toward Beinn Dearg a year ago, when Daffy insisted we leave it at an early stage and clamber up through snow-covered heather onto a large rounded ridge which seemed to go on forever before finally nearing the summit of Eididh nan Clach Geala. Fortunately no such deviations were ordered this year, which was just as well since I was on strangely good form viz-a-viz walking, and enjoyed setting a pace up the stream-crossed path until it eventually disappeared, at which point I reverted to my more familiar snail’s pace.

    <p>Sunday a handful of us bagged Ben Wyvis, where apparently Martin Moran was avalanched during his record breaking winter munro expedition. Our trip up to the top was thankfully less life-threatening, with the only dangers coming from the many snowball fights, or riding over rocks during the pitifully slow bum-slide back to the soggy foothills. But the sun was out in force, as were the views. It was a good start to the holiday proper, and served as a gentle reminder how unfit I am, as I soon found myself lagging behind all and sundry during the ascent.

    <p>Boy, do I let myself in for some exhausting pastimes. I could have spent the day at home, slumped in front of the web, but nope, not today. Gulvain is a right royal pain. A “shy hill”, according to the books, which basically means you have to walk for miles before you reach its foot. Then you have a steep walk upwards before reaching what, admittedly, is a fairly enjoyable ridge. Or at least I imagine it would be were it possible to see more then a few metres ahead of you. Seeing a trig point emerging out of the mist on an otherwise barren landscape is quite a spooky experience – I felt vaguely akin to one of the monkeys at the start of 2001 – A Space Odyssey, surrounding that vast solid pillar inquisitively. But there wasn’t time to peruse on this for too long, as the evening was drawing in and we had a date to keep in Ullapool.

    <p> Brucey’s protective, cautionary side does not show itself often, but it’s undoubtedly there. One of his female housemates once commented that “he really looks after us in the flat, he’s like the Dad of the house!” and I can now sort of imagine how this is true. I get the feeling people are likely to misrepresent him as being some kind of mad Scottish loony, especially when up on the munros, risking his life for the sake of a quick bag or a bit of a laugh, but I’m beginning to think that under the “ker-azy” exterior, he’s alarmingly sensible. Posit: we’re at the bottom of a gorgeous snow-covered gully on Buachaille Etive Mor, and I’m gagging to don some crampons (lent to me by the man himself), and get going. But Brucey has other ideas:

    <p>I still can’t quite believe that we all woke up at 6:30am on a Saturday. But evidently it happened. The journey up to Killin was fantastic, truly amazing. All the floods, cloud, and rain had been left behind in England – we had clear open skies and sunny snow-topped peaks. Bruce quickly ran out of superlatives, and decided to start inventing more, declaring this to be a ‘riptastic’ day. We had to park up occasionally during the journey to take more photos, the scenery was just so fine.

I’m really not fit enough for this lark. As Rich later said, “Nel has invented a pace between stop and walk.” But at least I give it a go and get away from the PC once in a while. Can’t get much further away from it than Ben Macdui – just a shame we didn’t reach the summit until almost dusk. Oopsy. By the time we got to the bothy it was pitch darkness, and the bothy was full of people who showed no intentions of squeezing up. So after some chicken soup and bread (supplementing the two Mars Bars we had already eaten that day – bloaters or what?) we got into sleeping bags and survival bags for a rather damp night’s sleep. The first time I’ve ever worn a woolley hat while sleeping, and hopefully the last. Oh well, at least it didn’t rain.
