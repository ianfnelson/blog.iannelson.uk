    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Many moons (and about four jobs) ago, a wise DBA by the name of David Hanson once recommended to me a book called Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Unleashed. I took his advice, bought a copy, and it rapidly became one of the most dog-eared and oft-thumbed computing books I have ever owned. It is comprehensive, deep, broad, well-written and covers everything one might ever wish to know about SQL Server 2000. With its help and guidance I came to love and respect Microsoft’s premier database product, passing the 70-229 exam by a comfortable margin.

    <p>I’m off to the MSDN Technical roadshow in Harrogate tomorrow, and am actually really looking forward to it this time. These events are free, so always well worth attending when they’re local, but some years are certainly better than others – it mostly depends on the material being covered. I remember one year circa 2003-4, when .NET was well established, but before the Whidbey release, so the majority of the day was effectively just a sales pitch covering elementary .NET concepts, presumably for those laggards who hadn’t yet made the great leap from VB6. Another data-binding demo, anybody? Yawn.

Tufte’s excellent The Visual Display of Quantitative Information in a recent blog post, it prompted me to search North Yorkshire’s online library catalogue to see if they had any more of the great man’s works. I was delighted to find that both Envisioning Information and Visual Explanations were available, yet languishing in a storage room somewhere rather than being on the shelves of one of the county’s libraries! So, I placed a request and they turned up at my local branch a few days later.

We spent a couple of nights at the Stratosphere Hotel in Las Vegas, which is the tallest observation tower in the United States. Atop the tower are three “thrill rides”, and I foolishly tried all of them whilst Jocelyn videoed proceedings from a safe distance.

I felt sure that some of the new Generic classes in the .NET 2.0 FCL would help me in my quest. Specifically, as I often need to expose simple arrays of Key/Value Pair metadata, I planned to create an instance of the System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection class, containing a bunch of System.Collections.Generic.KeyValuePair objects. ...</p>

However, a little bit of Googling and I came across this excellent BigInteger class on Code Project which does everything I need and more – and it seems bloody fast, too. Thanks to this class, I’ve been able to knock off several more problems this weekend, and now have a rating of “11% Genius” – still some way to go, then…

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">USA Trip 2006: Breakfast Prep
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>On our first morning in California, we headed out to breakfast, which was preceded by a short session of Breakfast Prep’, courtesy of Jocelyn. It had been a couple of years since I’d last had Breakfast In America, and I’d forgotten how to respond to the awesome number of choices and options that would be flung in my direction by the waitperson.
Here’s how you order breakfast in Britain:
&lt;td&gt; &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_English_Breakfast&#34;&gt;Full English Breakfast&lt;/a&gt;, please.&amp;#8221; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Waitress: &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &amp;#8220;D’you want tea or coffee with that?&amp;#8221; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Diner: &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &amp;#8220;Tea, please.&amp;#8221; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; Waitress: &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &amp;#8220;OK.&amp;#8221; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; In due course, the standard, empire-forging breakfast is served, and is consumed heartily, perhaps after a little trading with your breakfasting companions (“I’ll swap you my tomatoes for a rasher of your bacon?”). Everybody knows what is expected, nobody has tricky decisions to make, there are no surprises, and everyone enjoys what they get – and if they don’t enjoy it, well, they don’t mention it, because complaining about such things just wouldn’t be British, damn it.

    <p>Monday 10th April 2006
The sun was still shining as we touched down at SFO, about 22 hours after we’d woken up. If every day could last that long, I swear I’d get more work done – or maybe I’d just spend more time playing Civilization…
We picked up the car – a Pontiac Impala which initially seemed unfeasibly huge compared to our Focus, but it’s funny how quickly you adjust and get used to the size, making use of the available space – then it was off down US 101 on the final leg of our journey. Despite it being rush hour, we had a swift journey due to being able to use the Car Pool lane (by virtue of not being a single-occupant vehicle). I was amazed how under-utilised this lane was, and started wondering how much of an incentive would be needed for more Bay area commuters to start sharing rides – there’s another good question for the economists to ponder.

    <p>_Monday 10th April 2006
Travelling West during the daytime is a blast, especially on a sunny day. Time it right and you can experience daylight for 24 hours, which afforded me time to catch up on some reading. For Christmas Joce had given a book entitled Freakonomics – A Rogue Economist Explores The Hidden Side Of Eveything, and now I finally had time to read through it. I surprised myself by finishing it by the time we reached Chicago – this may be a chunky hardback book on economics, but it’s also really interesting and easy-going.

    <p>Last month Jocelyn and I took a trip to the States to visit friends and family, attend Teri &amp; Jimmy’s wedding, and take a vacation to Nevada and Arizona.
So, there we were, sitting at the departure gate at Manchester Airport on a bright Monday morning, having awoken at 0430 to make our way across the Pennines. A few seats away were a group of teenagers. They were from Michigan, and they were annoyingly noisy. Thus began our American adventure.
