      <title>Temperature Blanket – A Rare Opportunity for My Coding to Assist Jocelyn&#39;s Crafting</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the resident geek in our family, it won’t surprise you to hear that I am occasionally approached by Jocelyn and our kids to provide tech support. Sadly, most of these queries are invariably of the “how do I print from my phone” or “the Sky box stopped working” ilk, and rarely trouble my software skills. So it came as a pleasant surprise when I recently encountered a genuine reason to use .NET, APIs and Docker in support of one of Jocelyn’s craft projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DDDNorth 2014 Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had no excuse for not attending &lt;a href=&#34;http://dddnorth.co.uk/&#34;&gt;DDDNorth&lt;/a&gt; this year, as it was held at Leeds University, a relatively short drive from home. Not that I’d be looking for an excuse – these free events are always superbly organised and provide a valuable opportunity to see sessions from a wide range of speakers without having to take time off work. It’s no wonder the tickets are always snapped up so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This dumb mistake just cost me an hour spelunking around in the debugger:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately the ramifications were picked up in the acceptance tests, but the root cause wasn’t at all obvious from such a high level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson for the day – code is never too trivial to warrant unit testing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long time since I posted a blog entry tagged with “&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/tag/genealogy&#34;&gt;genealogy&lt;/a&gt;” (over three years, in fact). I find it to be a hobby that I pursue in fits and starts – periods of all-encompassing obsession followed by long periods of total inactivity. But the old &lt;a href=&#34;https://familytree.iannelson.uk&#34;&gt;Family Tree&lt;/a&gt; has been fleshed out nicely since I last updated you, dear reader. It has also acquired a most surprising and welcome addition.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Entity Framework Week Part 5: Concluding Thoughts</title>
      <link>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/entity-framework-week-part-5-concluding-thoughts/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the fifth in a series of five posts recounting my experiences using Entity Framework Code-First to replace ADO.NET and stored procedures in a client’s existing application. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/entity-framework-week-part-1-introduction-configuration-and-initialization/&#34;&gt;The introductory post in the series is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am lucky to have had the opportunity to spend a time-boxed period playing with &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399572.aspx&#34;&gt;Entity Framework&lt;/a&gt; Code-First in a real-world scenario, and to get paid for the privilege! I now have a clearer understanding of how it has progressed during the last few years, what its strong points are, and where it still has shortcomings compared to the much more mature &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nhforge.org&#34;&gt;NHibernate&lt;/a&gt; framework.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Entity Framework Week Part 4: Features and Further Investigations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the fourth in a series of five posts recounting my experiences using Entity Framework Code-First to replace ADO.NET and stored procedures in a client’s existing application. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/entity-framework-week-part-1-introduction-configuration-and-initialization/&#34;&gt;The introductory post in the series is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t want this series of posts to descend into a point-scoring &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nhforge.org&#34;&gt;NHibernate&lt;/a&gt;-versus-&lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399572.aspx&#34;&gt;Entity Framework&lt;/a&gt; comparison, but…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now have a basic proof-of-concept up and running, with my client’s nascent application now being powered by Entity Framework Code-First CTP5 rather than a hand-rolled DAL. So, I had some time to consider future functional and non-functional requirements that the team would be asked to develop and support, and investigate how EF would meet the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Having configured and initialized &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399572.aspx&#34;&gt;Entity Framework&lt;/a&gt;, and tweaked the mappings, by Day 3 I was all set to start consuming my shiny new DbContext implementation from the application code, and actually get some CRUD work done. Not unexpectedly, I hit a few issues along the way…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Entity Framework Week Part 2: Conventions and Fluent Mappings</title>

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in yesterday’s post, I was attempting to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399572.aspx&#34;&gt;Entity Framework&lt;/a&gt; Code-First CTP5 to map an existing domain model to an existing database schema. Fortunately the project was in its infancy and there was a high degree of cohesion between the two models. I therefore didn’t anticipate too many difficulties ahead – the occasional naming discrepancy to resolve, and table-per-hierarchy mappings that would need their discriminators specifying – nothing too complicated really. I hoped to make as few changes as possible to either the database schema or domain model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Entity Framework Week Part 1: Introduction, Configuration and Initialization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In February 2011 I found myself doing some contract development work in a team that was still doing data access using raw ADO.NET and stored procedures. Being the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nhforge.org&#34;&gt;NHibernate&lt;/a&gt; fanboy that I am, I naturally attempted to persuade them of the benefits of moving over to NH, even going so far as to develop (in my own time) an NH-powered version of their application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My efforts were &lt;em&gt;partially&lt;/em&gt; successful. The team were sold on the idea of using an ORM, but wanted me to develop a second proof of concept using Microsoft ADO.NET &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399572.aspx&#34;&gt;Entity Framework&lt;/a&gt; rather than NHibernate. This prompted much mirth amongst my FaceBook friends.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That is, the suggestion that Application A can leverage the functionality of Application B by simply adding references to B’s DLLs. After all, this potential for reuse is why we put our code in reusable assemblies in the first place, isn’t it..?!&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MVC – Where To Put Business Logic?</title>
      <link>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/mvc-where-to-put-business-logic/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2010 12:11:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/mvc-where-to-put-business-logic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just had an email from a friend asking where business logic should go when using MVC – the controller or the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I’d share my reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think asking whether the business logic should go in the Model or the Controller is a false dichotomy. There are different kinds of business logic, and there’s also the possibility of putting it somewhere else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much business logic does indeed belong in the model, particularly stuff like encapsulating calculations and projections, adding meaning to raw data properties, and ensuring domain objects are maintained in a valid state. I see this as the traditional side of OO design – encapsulating logic and restricting accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Testing IoC Registrations</title>

      <guid>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/testing-ioc-registrations/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started writing automated unit tests for my code, I remember getting carried away writing lots of tiny little tests, each with a single Assert. It felt good initially to see all those green ticks, but rapidly became a maintenance headache, and I am now happier having fewer less-brittle tests that do more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s great when tools like &lt;a href=&#34;http://automapper.codeplex.com/&#34;&gt;AutoMapper&lt;/a&gt; provide powerful methods like…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…allowing me to test large swathes of the system configuration with a single, stable test.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/testing-linq-queries/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been asked “How do you test LINQ queries?” a couple of times in the past few months, so I thought I’d blog my answer for the benefit of all you lovely people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly I should explain how I’ve been doing most of my data access in recent months. I find that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html&#34;&gt;Repository pattern&lt;/a&gt;, and particularly the &lt;a href=&#34;http://fabiomaulo.blogspot.com/2009/09/repository-or-dao-repository.html&#34;&gt;.NET implementation described here by Fabio Maulo&lt;/a&gt; meets the vast majority of requirements I have in my applications, and I fall back on additionally using custom DAOs when required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>WCF – Global Exception Handling</title>
      <link>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/wcf-global-exception-handling/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2010 13:04:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/wcf-global-exception-handling/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve done a fair bit of WCF development recently (and amazingly I came out of it relatively unscathed, both psychologically and emotionally). Using Castle Windsor’s WCF Facility helped a great deal, but I still found myself writing a fair bit of infrastructure and plumbing code. I thought I’d blog some of these code snippets lest I forget, and on the offchance they might help others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I wanted to achieve was to ensure that any unhandled exceptions that propagated to the top of the stack were logged. The following custom EndpointBehavior achieves that. I’m using Castle Logging Facility here, but you could of course swap out the logging code for whatever error handling code you require.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>WCF – Logging Before and After Operation Invocation</title>
      <link>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/wcf-logging-before-and-after-operation-invocation/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2010 13:04:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/wcf-logging-before-and-after-operation-invocation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s another custom WCF EndpointBehavior I found useful recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not content with &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/wcf-global-exception-handling/&#34;&gt;logging all unhandled errors&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to output a DEBUG level log message before and after every operation invocation. As before, I’m using the Castle Windsor Logging Facility to handle my logging, but you can swap that out for your logger of choice if required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, here’s the EndPointBehaviour itself. This adds a custom CallContextInitializer to every service operation:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>WCF – NHibernate Unit Of Work Endpoint Behavior</title>
      <link>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/wcf-nhibernate-unit-of-work-endpoint-behavior/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2010 13:04:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/wcf-nhibernate-unit-of-work-endpoint-behavior/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, my last WCF-related code snippet of the day, I promise. This is quite similar to the last one. I required that the WCF service I was developing started a new NHibernate Session for each invocation, and closed it after invocation (i.e. session-per-request). I couldn’t rely on the ASP.NET session start and end events in global.asax as this particular WCF service was to respond to MSMQ messages rather than HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An MVC Gotcha and the PRG Pattern</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve recently moved across to ASP.NET MVC development following years of wrangling with the leaky abstraction that was WebForms, you may have encountered some seemingly curious behaviour when posting back to the same URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have the following simple, contrived and utterly imagination-free model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s the controller:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that we have two separate Index actions – one for HTTP GET which instantiates and displays a new FooModel instance, and one for HTTP POST which modifies one of the properties on the posted FooModel instance before re-rendering the view.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post comes to you live from a Starbucks in the north of England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wrapped up another eight months’ stint contracting at my old haunt &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marshalls.com/&#34;&gt;Marshalls Plc&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been a genuinely interesting gig, working on two distinct greenfield projects using bang up to date technologies including .NET 4.0 and MVC2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it hasn’t just been a benefit for my CV, I think Marshalls might have got a little something out of the arrangement too, as Marshalls’ Development Manager Sion Harrison commented yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, early one morning, my friend and fellow coder Scott asked a curious question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you think that programming computers for a living gives you a negative outlook on life?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Scott is unfortunately responsible for administering occasional TLC to a codebase that I cut as long ago as 2004, so I assumed he was referring to this and was about to raise some complaints about my hand-rolled query object criteria framework or other coding horror. I steeled myself to defend my work as he continued to explain:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Funny, but not true. I am enamoured with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castleproject.org/container/index.html&#34;&gt;Castle Windsor&lt;/a&gt; project because its power makes it fairly simple for me to develop loosely-coupled systems which are easily maintained and tested. The wide range of Facilities and Contrib projects also integrate nicely with the other parts of my current development stack (NHibernate, WCF, WF, log4net).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Castle Windsor Array Resolution Gotcha</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The shiny new system which I’ve recently been developing makes heavy use of the Chain of Responsibility pattern, and as such a number of service classes take an array of objects in the constructor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m using Castle Windsor for dependency management, so I’ve been fluently registering all instances of ILeadAllocator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy, right? And yet at runtime Windsor surprised me by throwing this exception in my face:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Castle.MicroKernel.Handlers.HandlerException: Can’t create component ‘Marshalls.Leads.ApplicationService.LeadAllocationService’ as it has dependencies to be satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been making heavy use of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castleproject.org/container/index.html&#34;&gt;Castle Windsor&lt;/a&gt; container to handle dependency and configuration management in the shiny new system that I’m currently developing. For the most part it’s been an absolute blast, allowing me to easily create a loosely-coupled system architecture and focus my efforts on what the system should be achieving for the client, rather than worrying about how it all hangs together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Improvements to the Execution Plan UI in SQL Server Management Studio 2008 sure do make it a doddle to improve query execution time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A client just reported that a particular stored procedure kept timing out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viewing the Estimated Execution Plan for this query displayed a nice green message advising of a potentially missing index which could improve performance by &amp;gt;95%:&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the Leeds area next Wednesday, why not come along to this Agile Yorkshire session?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;10th-june-8211-gojko-adzic-slim-the-future-of-fitnesse&#34;&gt;10th June – Gojko Adzic: Slim, The Future Of FitNesse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will introduce Slim, the most important upgrade to &lt;a href=&#34;http://fitnesse.org/&#34;&gt;FitNesse&lt;/a&gt; in years. Slim is the new test runner which promises to bring platform interoperability, easier integration, a much simpler programming model and lots of small helpers that will allow us to write and maintain executable specifications and acceptance tests easier. This is a session for .NET and Java developers. Some prior exposure to FitNesse and FIT would be beneficial, but not required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The inimitable &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ayende.com&#34;&gt;Ayende Rahien&lt;/a&gt; is close to releasing version 1.0 of his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nhprof.com&#34;&gt;NHibernate Profiler&lt;/a&gt; tool, and it really is shaping up to be a rather lovely little addition to my developer toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In much the same way that we can use &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181091.aspx&#34;&gt;SQL Server Profiler&lt;/a&gt; to monitor database activity, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.red-gate.com/products/ants_performance_profiler/&#34;&gt;ANTS Profiler&lt;/a&gt; to monitor the performance and memory usage of .NET applications, NHProf profiles the activity of the data access layer (&lt;a href=&#34;http://nhforge.org&#34;&gt;NHibernate&lt;/a&gt;), and even goes as far as providing helpful hints for potential improvements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TFS: Using Alternative Diff/Merge Tools</title>
      <link>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/tfs-alternative-diff-merge-tools/</link>

      <guid>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/tfs-alternative-diff-merge-tools/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many things I love about Team Foundation Server, but the supplied diff/merge tool is not one of them. It is – how can I put this? – somewhat basic. Indeed, I’ve heard tell of people going out of their way to avoid merges purely because they find the process so clunky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the good news – you can easily configure TFS to use a different, third-party, diff/merge tool, perhaps the one you’ve grown to know and love over many years of happy software development using other SCM products. Maybe you like &lt;a href=&#34;http://winmerge.org/&#34;&gt;WinMerge&lt;/a&gt;, or love &lt;a href=&#34;http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/TortoiseMerge.html&#34;&gt;TortoiseMerge&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps you’re like my friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.johnsadventures.com&#34;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; and swear by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/downloads.html&#34;&gt;SourceGear DiffMerge&lt;/a&gt;. Or maybe, like me, you’re a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scootersoftware.com/&#34;&gt;Beyond Compare&lt;/a&gt; fanboy. No problem, they can all be used by TFS. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If I can get a pass out from helping to look after the burgeoning Nelson family for an evening, I’ll be going along to this Agile Yorkshire session next Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;may-13th-ralph-williams-exploratory-testing&#34;&gt;May 13th – Ralph Williams: Exploratory Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Ralph will provide an overview of some techniques that bring Agility into the world of testing. (The world of testing is a strange place: regarded by most people as a nice place to visit but you wouldn’t want to live there, it is an unmapped wilderness where the waterfall methodology still roams unfettered.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a ludicrously speedy labour, Isla entered the world in an ambulance on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://maps.google.co.uk/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=53.907916,-1.18456&amp;amp;spn=0.00273,0.006673&amp;amp;z=17&#34;&gt;eastbound A64 near Bilbrough services&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday 28th April at 18:09 local time (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=28&amp;amp;month=4&amp;amp;year=2009&amp;amp;hour=18&amp;amp;min=9&amp;amp;sec=0&amp;amp;p1=136&#34;&gt;see this time in your time zone&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her birth mass was 3.750 kilograms (8 pounds 4 ounces), and length was 50 centimetres (20 inches).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Alt.Net UK In The North</title>

      <guid>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/alt-net-uk-in-the-north/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent much of this weekend over in Bradford, talking shop with the good folks at the Alt.Net UK ‘in the North’ conference. I had a great time, learned much, and am grateful to &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.blackmarble.co.uk/blogs/rfennell/&#34;&gt;Richard Fennell&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blackmarble.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Black Marble&lt;/a&gt; and the other organisers and sponsors for making the event possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology&#34;&gt;Open Spaces&lt;/a&gt; event I’ve attended, and I was pleasantly surprised at how orderly and productive the sessions turned out to be. Unlike conventional sales-pitch conferences of the MSDN roadshow variety, this was more of an open forum, with an expectation that all of the relatively small number (25ish?) of participants would, well, &lt;em&gt;participate&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m coming round to the realization that my hugely enjoyable first contract at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ventura.co.uk&#34;&gt;Ventura&lt;/a&gt; last summer might have been something of an anomaly. That project was decidedly agile, test-driven, and used a bunch of modern technologies including Monorail, ExtJS, Subversion, NUnit and NHibernate. The requirements were well-defined, and the team was highly effective, with a pragmatic project management team who kept the development team free from bureaucratic processes, leaving us able to get on with delivering some cracking software in double-quick time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My current primary client has an annoying habit of closing for random days and half-days, including last Thursday afternoon. I decided to try to make the most of this time off, by taking &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exams/70-553.mspx&#34;&gt;Microsoft exam 70-553&lt;/a&gt;, which has the snappy title “&lt;em&gt;UPGRADE: MCSD Microsoft .NET Skills to MCPD Enterprise Application Developer by Using the Microsoft .NET Framework: Part 1&lt;/em&gt;”. I’ve already passed the second part of the upgrade process (70-554), so passing this exam would give me no fewer than four new certifications, including the prestigious MCPD Enterprise Application Developer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the least surprising but more significant announcements to come out of &lt;a href=&#34;http://live.visitmix.com/&#34;&gt;Mix ‘09&lt;/a&gt; last week was the general availability of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.asp.net/mvc/&#34;&gt;ASP.NET MVC 1.0&lt;/a&gt;. The development process for this framework has been very transparent, with no fewer than eight previews, betas and release candidates made available over the past year or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft are being careful to tout ASP.NET MVC as being “an alternative, not a replacement, for ASP.NET Web Forms”, but just look at their list of some of its benefits:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, base rates are now down to 1.0%, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/zero-interest-bug/&#34;&gt;Zero Interest Bug&lt;/a&gt; is not just conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/property_and_mortgages/article5668432.ece&#34;&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, dear readers, today I’d like to talk about tools.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software development isn’t really so different from traditional skilled crafts in that it is important to have an understanding of the tools available to help you create a quality products in the least amount of time possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For .NET developers, the Visual Studio IDE is usually just the starting point, and most of us will come to rely on some of the tools listed in Scott Hanselman’s famous &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hanselman.com/tools&#34;&gt;tools list&lt;/a&gt;. Personally, I can’t imagine coding without first installing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devexpress.com/refactor&#34;&gt;Refactor Pro&lt;/a&gt;, editing text files in anything other than &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.textpad.com&#34;&gt;TextPad&lt;/a&gt;, or working on a machine that doesn’t have &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/snagit/&#34;&gt;Snag It&lt;/a&gt; installed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when you join a new team as a .NET developer, the team lead proudly points you in the direction of a Word document or wiki page detailing the team’s house coding standards.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, these documents are invariably:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incomplete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subjective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not enforced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Largely copied from the interweb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obsessed with the trivial (e.g. whitespace) while failing to mention the genuinely useful (e.g. boxing/unboxing, avoiding use of deprecated classes, Dispose pattern, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this because I’ve been involved in creating such documents in the past 🙂&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the multiple hats that I’m currently wearing for a client is that of SQL Server DBA. In this guise, I have recently fielded a couple of email queries from users concerned about the data recovery options available to them, should application data be inadvertently deleted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What kind of database backup and restore mechanism is in place for [application]? If someone deletes any data from [application] front end is it possible to restore it? Generally the way to recover data would be to restore the database from a database backup file, however this would restore all data held in the backup and would overwrite any changes made since the time of the backup.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week I picked up a hire car and headed over to deepest Cheshire to install an instance of Team Foundation Server 2008 for a client. Before setting off, I tried to make sure that all the prerequisites were in place – i.e. that there was a suitably-specced server available for use, which was connected to the domain, that all the necessary service accounts were created, and firewall ports opened, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started my career in professional software development a decade or so ago by testing and fixing banking code that had fallen victim to the millennium bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could the prospect of zero percent interest rates create a similar boom in demand for software developers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.contractoruk.com/004128.html&#34;&gt;Contractor UK&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest rates have plummeted from 5% to 2% since early October and are heading lower. Some analysts say 0% is not out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier today a dev came over to ask me about a compiler warning he was getting when building a .NET solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSB3247: Found conflicts between different versions of the same dependent assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is basically telling you that one project or dependency in your solution is referencing one version of an assembly, whilst another project or dependency is trying to reference a different version of the same assembly. Unhelpfully, the message and build output don’t tell you &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; dependent assembly is causing the problem!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Performance of Loops on Collections</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/archive/2008/11/19/an-easy-and-efficient-way-to-improve-net-code-performances.aspx&#34;&gt;Interesting article&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia&#34;&gt;Patrick Smacchia&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ndepend.com&#34;&gt;NDepend&lt;/a&gt; guy) in which he runs some benchmarks on the cost of looping in different ways over different constructs and comes to the conclusion that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“looping on array using for is &lt;strong&gt;5 times cheaper&lt;/strong&gt; than looping on List&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; using foreach (which I believe, is what we all do)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well worth a read, although I suspect that in my solutions the bottlenecks will remain the out-of-process calls, i.e. database access and web service calls. Still, a 5x gain is not to be sniffed at.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>12 Reasons Why I Love Unit Tests</title>
      <link>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/12-reasons-why-i-love-unit-tests/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2008 22:11:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/12-reasons-why-i-love-unit-tests/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On my continuing journey through this thrilling world of professional software development, I frequently encounter teams who hold no truck with this crazy new-fangled concept of unit testing. Heck, truth be told, I sometimes come across teams who don’t use &lt;em&gt;source control&lt;/em&gt;, but that’s by the bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these situations, I try my best to lead by example, continuing to practise TDD on any new code that I cut, and insisting on covering with unit tests any pre-existing code which I have to modify. Sooner or later, this prompts someone to ask why I am doing this (often insinuating that I am wasting my time, and by implication the client’s money). At that point, flustered, I invariably struggle to remember or adequately articulate the many and various ways in which unit testing makes me a better developer. So, consider this blog post a personal aide-mémoire to help me the next time this occurs (as well as being a homage to &lt;a href=&#34;http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=DW1AHrTNBao&#34;&gt;Jake Shillingford’s second-best song&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A British Wifey</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was a proud day indeed. Remember four years ago when I &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/we-have-governmental-approval/&#34;&gt;blogged about Jocelyn getting a fiancee visa from the British Consulate in Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, which paved the way for her to travel to Blighty with the intention of marrying me..?&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, since then we’ve turned that fiancee visa into a limited leave visa, and then into a settlement visa. We have spent over £2000 on government fees for these various rubber stamps – outrageously high amounts which resulted in letters being sent &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/happy-anniversary-now-cough-up/&#34;&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/immigration-fees-the-home-office-respond/&#34;&gt;from&lt;/a&gt; the Home Office. Along the way, we got married, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/back-in-the-land-of-the-blogging/&#34;&gt;moved house&lt;/a&gt;, and of course &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/benjamin-george-nelson/&#34;&gt;Benjamin&lt;/a&gt; came along to change our lives forever (in a good way, of course, Son!).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My good buddy &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.johnsadventures.com&#34;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; just published &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.johnsadventures.com/archives/2008/08/the-contents-of-my-wallet.html&#34;&gt;a typically navel-gazing post detailing the contents of his wallet&lt;/a&gt;, and went on to invite readers to divulge details of their own &lt;em&gt;billfolds&lt;/em&gt; in what I can only presume is some cunning and evil plan for mass identity-theft 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as I said in the comments to John’s post, I was surprised at the quantity of sentimental knick-knacks and memorabilia he has in there, compared to the rather prosaic and functional contents of my own wallet.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Keyboard Makes A Hell Of A Difference</title>
      <link>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/a-keyboard-makes-a-hell-of-a-difference/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2008 16:08:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/a-keyboard-makes-a-hell-of-a-difference/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me recently that I’m not getting any younger, and that sitting hunched over a keyboard for a dozen hours a day will probably lead to some form of RSI sooner or later. So I started looking for ways to improve my daily working environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.johnsadventures.com/archives/2008/05/a-chair-makes-a-hell-of-a-difference.html&#34;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;, I can’t afford a Herman Miller chair, and even if I could, I’m a freelancer rather than a telecommuter* so I would have to regularly carry the chair on the train to client sites, where they would probably ostracise me for being a weirdo who brings his own chair to the office. So I looked for something a little more portable, and decided that perhaps it was finally time for me to try one of those fancy split ergonomic keyboards that I’ve always scoffed at. After reading a few review on Amazon, I plumped for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/RPdDlW&#34;&gt;Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Database Design – Still Important In These ORM-Obsessed Days</title>

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a corollary for you: The use of ORM tools doesn’t absolve the need to maintain good database design principles, and even NHibernate won’t save you from your own stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following an application upgrade release last night, I’ve spent a disproportionate amount of today trying to debug the following exception, which appeared to originate in an area of the codebase which I personally had heavily modified:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Remember The Milk</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2008 06:06:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/remember-the-milk/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In response to &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/2008/05/guest-post-advanced-gtd-with-remember.html&#34;&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that I’d shared in Google Reader, &lt;a href=&#34;http://jpg1723.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Jez&lt;/a&gt; emailed me to ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Do you use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rememberthemilk.com&#34;&gt;RTM&lt;/a&gt;? It’s always been one of those web apps that seem really useful, but I’ve never made the leap to actually using it in anger. I suppose you need to adopt it in tandem with the five-point &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done&#34;&gt;GTD&lt;/a&gt; philosophy to get real benefit?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Yes, I do use RTM, and I love it. I’ve been looking for a decent way of managing my to-do lists effectively for years, and RTM really scratches that itch! I now have the web app permanently open in a Firefox tab, and use “MilkSync” to synchronize with my Pocket PC every half hour.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On the Joys of Object-Relational Mapping</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Ian Nelson. I’m a recovering &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;SQL&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; addict. It’s been four weeks since my last stored procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my reasons for &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/going-for-it/&#34;&gt;leaving my cosy permanent job and entering the scary cut-throat world of freelancing&lt;/a&gt; was to get a broader exposure to different tools, technologies and methodologies, while remaining with my feet planted firmly in the .NET universe. So, when I got offered a position in a team who were using &lt;a href=&#34;http://subversion.tigris.org/&#34;&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castleproject.org/MonoRail/&#34;&gt;Monorail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://extjs.com/&#34;&gt;Ext.JS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nunit.org&#34;&gt;NUnit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/database/index.html&#34;&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nhibernate.org&#34;&gt;NHibernate&lt;/a&gt;, I jumped at the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been a fan of those &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.allposters.com/-st/Motivational-Posters_c12920_p6_.htm&#34;&gt;motivational posters&lt;/a&gt; that you see on office walls (usually in sales or marketing departments) that attempt to depict a word like “Opportunity” or “Teamwork” with a single image, usual of some nature scene or a lone individual rising above the odds to achieve a difficult goal. To my mind they always look a bit facile, glib and superficial. “Destiny” equates to a holiday villa on the Maldives?  “Integrity” is a Lion? “Success” appears to involve hang-gliding off towards the ocean in an action which brings to mind Reginald Perrin?! I demand more thought and more words from my motivational office decorations!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Inside Microsoft SQL Server 2005: The Storage Engine</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During 2007, I unexpectedly achieved a long-held ambition by increasing the number of books I regularly read (as opposed to merely buying, then leaving them to languish on the bookcase!). I read plenty of techie books of course, but also made use of local libraries and devoured plenty of books on other subjects, and even found time for some fiction. I think having a young baby in the house was partially responsible for this achievement – not much else to do of an evening any more!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/family-tree-update/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the return of the dark wintry nights to this sceptered isle, I’ve been taking the opportunity to flesh out &lt;a href=&#34;https://familytree.iannelson.uk&#34;&gt;my Family Tree&lt;/a&gt; a little more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it isn’t just the addition of young &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/benjamin-george-nelson/&#34;&gt;Benjamin&lt;/a&gt; – since I last uploaded a tree eleven months ago, I’ve increased the number of individuals in my database by 55, to a total of 1114 from 307 family groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more than that, the quality and number of facts for many individuals has increased. This year, I’m trying to methodically work through my ancestors in a bit more detail and fill in some of the tricky gaps that I left last year when everything was new to me and there were plenty of “easy pickings” to be had.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ten years of professional software development have given me a healthy awareness of edge cases – I’m always trying to code defensively, validate input, catch exceptions, use assertions, and of course pick holes in sloppy specifications (“ah, but what if…”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must learn that these skills should not always be applied to my personal life though, as exemplified by a conversation with The Wife yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It gives me unparalleled joy to announce the birth of Mr Benjamin George Nelson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a relatively swift labour, the new arrival entered the world suddenly at York Hospital on Wednesday at 22:24 local time (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=25&amp;amp;month=7&amp;amp;year=2007&amp;amp;hour=22&amp;amp;min=24&amp;amp;sec=0&amp;amp;p1=136&#34;&gt;see this time in your time zone&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birth mass was 4.185 kilograms (9 pounds 3 ounces), length was 51 centimetres (20 inches).&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I had the pleasure of spending a few days in London attending the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.software-architect.co.uk&#34;&gt;Software Architect 2007&lt;/a&gt; conference at the Barbican centre. It was a good conference, providing me with some useful and interesting new ideas and food for thought, whilst confirming that our team at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marshalls.co.uk&#34;&gt;Marshalls&lt;/a&gt; are generally going about things in “the right way”, which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking through my notes, the main themes that kept recurring within the different presentations that I attended were:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A C# Postcode Struct with Parser</title>
      <link>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/a-c-postcode-struct-with-parser/</link>

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/postcode-validation/&#34;&gt;discussed recently&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve been trying to knock together a class struct to represent a UK postcode, provide a means of parsing a string as &lt;em&gt;potentially&lt;/em&gt; being a valid postcode (or optionally just an outer code), and split that postcode into “outer” and “inner” code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say &lt;em&gt;potentially&lt;/em&gt; because, as you’ll know if you’ve looked into this topic at all, it’s impossible to validate whether a string truly does represent a postcode without querying the (copyrighted and expensive-to-license) Postcode Address File.  As a result, my solution is not very stringent – it is possible to persuade it to successfully parse an invalid postcode, but hopefully there should be no occasions when a valid postcode is rejected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia cracks me up sometimes. I’m sat here at my desk, trying to knock together some C# code to quickly validate an entered string as being a UK postcode. Naturally I turned to this &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_postcodes&#34;&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; for assistance, where I find this quip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Automatic validation of postcodes on the basis of pattern feasibility is therefore almost impossible to design, and the system contains no self-validating feature such as a check digit. &lt;strong&gt;Completely accurate validation is only possible by attempting to deliver mail to the address, and verifying with the recipient.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many moons (and about four jobs) ago, a wise DBA by the name of David Hanson once recommended to me a book called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0672324679?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=ianesbl-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0672324679&#34;&gt;Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Unleashed&lt;/a&gt;. I took his advice, bought a copy, and it rapidly became one of the most dog-eared and oft-thumbed computing books I have ever owned. It is comprehensive, deep, broad, well-written and covers everything one might ever wish to know about SQL Server 2000. With its help and guidance I came to love and respect Microsoft’s premier database product, passing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-229.mspx&#34;&gt;70-229 exam&lt;/a&gt; by a comfortable margin.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

These events are free, so always well worth attending when they’re local, but some years are certainly better than others – it mostly depends on the material being covered. I remember one year circa 2003-4, when .NET was well established, but before the Whidbey release, so the majority of the day was effectively just a sales pitch covering elementary .NET concepts, presumably for those laggards who hadn’t yet made the great leap from VB6. Another data-binding demo, anybody?  Yawn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I mentioned Edward R. Tufte’s excellent &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0961392142?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=ianesbl-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0961392142&#34;&gt;The Visual Display of Quantitative Information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in a recent blog post, it prompted me to search North Yorkshire’s online library catalogue to see if they had any more of the great man’s works. I was delighted to find that both &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0961392118?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=ianesbl-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0961392118&#34;&gt;Envisioning Information&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0961392126?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=ianesbl-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0961392126&#34;&gt;Visual Explanations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; were available, yet languishing in a storage room somewhere rather than being on the shelves of one of the county’s libraries!  So, I placed a request and they turned up at my local branch a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I keep intending, and forgetting to post a couple of videos from our US holiday last April.  I suppose I was hoping to get round to writing up my paper notes from the holiday, but it’s becoming apparent that won’t happen anytime soon, so let’s skip forward to the funny bits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a couple of nights at the Stratosphere Hotel in Las Vegas, which is the tallest observation tower in the United States.  Atop the tower are three “thrill rides”, and I foolishly tried all of them whilst Jocelyn videoed proceedings from a safe distance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am now a Microsoft Certified Solution Developer in .NET 1.x technologies. This is a qualification that I’ve been working towards on and (more often than not) off for the past four years or so. It’s not really the case that the exams were super-hard, just that it took occasional motivation to get round to taking them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, was it worth it?  Did I learn anything en route?  Did the exams boost my employability?  Would I be more inclined to employ someone with an MCSD than an applicant without?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Private William Henry Worfolk (1896 – 1916) of the York and Lancaster Regiment was my Grandfather’s elder brother (by four years), and was only just old enough to fight (and die) in the First World War.  A couple of years later and it could just as easily have been my grandfather, and then I wouldn’t be here to tell you this tale.  Ninety years on from that most bloody of wars, we still have much to be thankful for.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Late last night I reached a small but significant milestone in my family tree research:  I now know the names of my sixteen great-great-grandparents!  Or so I believe – I just need to wait for a couple of certificates to arrive from the GRO to prove my theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, who do I think I am?  Well, at this stage it appears that my blood is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50.0% English&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;37.5% Scottish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12.5% Irish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those sixteen ancestors were born between 1829 and 1860.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in need of a new hobby for a while now.  The mental challenges offered from getting married, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/joining-avanade/&#34;&gt;changing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/back-to-the-old-house/&#34;&gt;jobs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/back-in-the-land-of-the-blogging/&#34;&gt;moving home&lt;/a&gt; have passed, and my free evenings and weekends were becoming prone to bouts of restlessness and sighs of “I’m bored”.  This is not a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I felt sure that some of the new Generic classes in the .NET 2.0 FCL would help me in my quest. Specifically, as I often need to expose simple arrays of Key/Value Pair metadata, I planned to create an instance of the  System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection class, containing a bunch of System.Collections.Generic.KeyValuePair objects. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/project-euler/&#34;&gt;last summer&lt;/a&gt;, I do enjoy whiling away a few hours attempting to solve the maths / progamming challenges set on &lt;a href=&#34;http://mathschallenge.net/index.php?section=project&#34;&gt;Project Euler&lt;/a&gt;. My language of choice for most puzzles is C#, but this hampered me on some of the questions as there is no in-built support for really big integers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a little bit of Googling and I came across this excellent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/biginteger.asp&#34;&gt;BigInteger class&lt;/a&gt; on Code Project which does everything I need and more – and it seems bloody fast, too. Thanks to this class, I’ve been able to knock off several more problems this weekend, and now have a rating of “11% Genius” – still some way to go, then…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>USA Trip 2006: Breakfast Prep</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On our first morning in California, we headed out to breakfast, which was preceded by a short session of Breakfast Prep’, courtesy of Jocelyn.  It had been a couple of years since I’d last had Breakfast In America, and I’d forgotten how to respond to the awesome number of choices and options that would be flung in my direction by the waitperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how you order breakfast in Britain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;
    &amp;amp;#8220;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_English_Breakfast&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Full English Breakfast&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, please.&amp;amp;#8221;
  &amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;
    Waitress:
  &amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
  
  &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;
    &amp;amp;#8220;D’you want tea or coffee with that?&amp;amp;#8221;
  &amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;
    Diner:
  &amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
  
  &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;
    &amp;amp;#8220;Tea, please.&amp;amp;#8221;
  &amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;
    &amp;amp;#8220;OK.&amp;amp;#8221;
  &amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In due course, the standard, empire-forging breakfast is served, and is consumed heartily, perhaps after a little trading with your breakfasting companions (“I’ll swap you my tomatoes for a rasher of your bacon?”).  Everybody knows what is expected, nobody has tricky decisions to make, there are no surprises, and everyone enjoys what they get – and if they don’t enjoy it, well, they don’t mention it, because complaining about such things just wouldn’t be British, damn it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monday 10th April 2006&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun was still shining as we touched down at SFO, about 22 hours after we’d woken up.  If every day could last that long, I swear I’d get more work done – or maybe I’d just spend more time playing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.civ4.com&#34;&gt;Civilization&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked up the car – a Pontiac Impala which initially seemed unfeasibly huge compared to our Focus, but it’s funny how quickly you adjust and get used to the size, making use of the available space – then it was off down US 101 on the final leg of our journey.  Despite it being rush hour, we had a swift journey due to being able to use the Car Pool lane (by virtue of not being a single-occupant vehicle).  I was amazed how under-utilised this lane was, and started wondering how much of an incentive would be needed for more Bay area commuters to start sharing rides – there’s another good question for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freakonomics.com&#34;&gt;the economists&lt;/a&gt; to ponder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So, there we were, sitting at the departure gate at Manchester Airport on a bright Monday morning, having awoken at 0430 to make our way across the Pennines.  A few seats away were a group of teenagers.  They were from Michigan, and they were annoyingly noisy.  Thus began our American adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in November 2004, I had the idea of making a &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/a-generic-sorter-for-strongly-typed-collections/&#34;&gt;Generic Sorter for Strongly-Typed Collections&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, by harnessing the mighty power of reflection. Well, earlier this month somebody anonymously emailed me some code that takes this to a whole different level, enabling sorting on multiple properties and to arbitrary depths within the domain model hierarchy, all by taking a single SQL-like parameter. It’s really very clever indeed, and I’m going to use this method in the future – thanks, anonymous code fairy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>String.IsNullOrEmpty</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The single most popular entry on this blog is, surprisingly enough, this &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/is-my-string-empty-some-c-performance-metrics/&#34;&gt;quick post from Summer 2004&lt;/a&gt; where I did a quick experiment to &amp;ldquo;prove&amp;rdquo; that in .NET the quickest way of proving that a string is empty is to compare its length to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as of .NET 2.0, we have a new static method on the System.String class – &lt;code&gt;IsNullOrEmpty&lt;/code&gt; – that allows you to easily test whether a string is, well, null or empty!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hertog Jan Doppio Double is the only one of my twenty-four Advent beers to come in a stone cork-stoppered bottle that weighs more than the drink contained within! At 7.3% ABV, it’s also the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/beer-advent-calendar-days-sixteen-and-seventeen/&#34;&gt;second-strongest&lt;/a&gt; drink in my selection, and hence has a real kick to it.  That said, it also has a gorgeous malty aroma, and strong aftertaste which beer lovers will appreciate.  So whilst it’s not quite my &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/beer-advent-calendar-day-six/&#34;&gt;personal favourite&lt;/a&gt; of the twenty-four beers I’ve had the pleasure of sampling this yuletide, it’s certainly an appropriately worthy and warming drink on which to finish.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The penultimate beer on my 2005 advent calendar was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stpetersbrewery.co.uk/range/prod_detail.asp?CatID=1&amp;amp;Code=RUCASE&#34;&gt;Ruby Red&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stpetersbrewery.co.uk/&#34;&gt;St. Peter’s Brewery&lt;/a&gt; in Suffolk.  I’d been looking forward to this 4.3% ABV red ale, which, like all of the beers from St. Peter’s, comes in a distinctive flask-shaped oval bottle, so I was somewhat disappointed by the intense bitterness of the first few mouthfuls.  However, I think this was mostly due to the effects of the Mexican dinner laced with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.enconasauces.co.uk&#34;&gt;Encona sauces&lt;/a&gt; that I’d scoffed a few minutes previously.  Further into the bottle, the “subtle malt undertones and spicy aroma” became more apparent, and overall I really enjoyed this beer – I’ll definitely be trying some of the others from the range.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fraoch.com/&#34;&gt;Fraoch&lt;/a&gt; is a 5% ABV Scottish beer that brings back many happy memories of late nights spent in the bar at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clachaig.com/&#34;&gt;Clachaig Inn&lt;/a&gt;.  “Fraoch” is the Gaelic for heather, so take a guess what this beer is made from?  If you’ve never tried it, that might sound a bit weird, but believe me that this is a great beer with “a floral, peaty aroma, full malt body, spicy herbal flavour and a dry wine like finish”.  What more could you ask for?  Slainte!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Jingle Knockers” isn’t exactly a phrase that inspires confidence, but this 5.5% ABV from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skinnersbrewery.com/&#34;&gt;Skinner’s Brewery&lt;/a&gt; in Cornwall is really good, definitely on a par with the stuff I’ve tried from Hambleton Ales and the Harviestoun Brewery.  Smooth and strong, with subtle hints of Christmas pud – mmmm…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you’re still confused by that name, the label handily explains all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Known as the Tin Mine Fairies, the Cornish Knockers used to guide the miners to the rich veins of ore by knocking.  With the demise of mining over the years, many knockers have ;returned to grass’ where, in disguise, they help with the brewing of their ales.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now, don’t get me wrong, there are many great things that have originated from America – not least of all my good lady wife – but I’ve always thought that “American Beer” is something of an anachronism!  Let’s face it, most beers from across the Altlantic are sorely lacking in flavour, body, bitterness, or, well, anything remotely beerlike.  So, whilst on my search for twenty-four bottled beers for this advent calendar, I was intrigued to find Honker’s Ale from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gooseisland.com/&#34;&gt;Goose Island Beer Company&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago which describes itself as “a smooth, drinkable English bitter for those drinkers who want more from their beer”.  Well, let’s hope they’re not looking for too much more, as it only comes in a 355ml bottle.  It tastes OK when compared to the likes of Budweiser and Samuel Adams, but it’s not exactly bold or challenging, and the whole experience was over far too quickly.  Not exactly one to savour on a cold winter’s night in Yorkshire, but I can imagine these going down quite well in the sports stadia of Iliinois.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Smuggler’s Ale is another bottled beer which found its way into my calendar via an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.asda-beer.co.uk/pages/competition.html&#34;&gt;Asda beer competition&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s 5% ABV, with hints of treacle, and is really rather enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to paraphrase Forrest Gump, that’s all I have to say about that.  Back to my beer and a DVD of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.familyguy.com&#34;&gt;Family Guy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s something a wee bit disappointing about picking up a bottle labelled “MOROCCO ALE” and finding that it is, in fact, from nowhere more distant than Harrogate – the Daleside Brewery to be precise.  According to the label:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The recipe for Morocco Ale is believed to date from Elizabethan times.  Colonel John Grahme of Levens was a courtier to James II and the name ‘Morocco’ may have been associated with the dark Moors who came to the court when Catherine of Braganza married Charles II and brought Tangiers as part of her dowry.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Friday night saw me out celebrating in Halifax at our departmental Christmas meal (FWIW, I drank a few pints of Santa’s Little Helper from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.caledonian-brewery.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Caledonian brewery&lt;/a&gt;).  As a result, I didn’t get chance to enjoy my advent beer, and have been playing catch-up with a couple of randomly-selected bottles tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the sixteenth beer to be selected from the vase of fate was Delirium Nocturnum, a &lt;strong&gt;9.0%&lt;/strong&gt; ABV dark ale from the Huyghe-Melle brewery in Belgium which comes in silver glittery 330ml bottles featuring pictures of pink elephants.  I was somewhat apprehensive, but needlessly so, as this is a surprisingly well-balanced and hoppy triply-fermented ale – not a novelty drink at all (despite the packaging being somewhat reminiscent of a Pizza Express salad dressing bottle).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gadzooks!  Who would have thought that it would be so difficult to find a few minutes each day to transcribe a few words about a bottle of beer?  But it is – especially as we enter the party season and my evenings are filled with festivities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is, I have three excellent beers to report on; the first two of which are from breweries that I’ve already “visited” during this advent calendar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Halfway through my great beer advent calendar 2005, and tonight I’ve enjoyed the popular Leffe Blonde, a potent and delicious 6.6% ABV beer from Belgium.  I’ve been meaning to try this reknowned tipple since I utterly failed to identify a snippet of the label in one of those irritating Excel-based quizzes that circulates on the interweb periodically.  Anyway, I wasn’t disappointed – the small bottle size (33cl) being more than made up for by the strength and the flavour (quite almondy, I thought).  There’s a good detailed review by someone with more effective taste buds than I over at the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bottledbeer.co.uk/index.html?beerid=386&#34;&gt;Oxford Bottled Beer Database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just realised that I forgot to blog about yesterday’s advent beer.  Sorry for keeping you all on tenterhooks like that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest I was a bit disappointed and couldn’t think of anything interesting to say about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.croptonbrewery.com/product.asp?cookiecheck=yes&amp;amp;P_ID=126&#34;&gt;Rudolph’s Revenge&lt;/a&gt;, a 4.6% ABV bitter from Cropton Brewery.  It was quite similar to the equally uninspiring &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/beer-advent-calendar-day-eight/&#34;&gt;Mars Magic&lt;/a&gt; from last Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What’s on your desktop background?  Some bland corporate logo perhaps, or maybe one of the bog-standard Windows wallpapers, or maybe a photograph you took years ago?&lt;br&gt;
Let’s face it, when was the last time you changed your background?  Wouldn’t it be great if you could specify a few keywords and have your background periodically change to show a new image courtesy of Flickr?  Say, a sunrise, a mountain, a wintry scene, a favourite holiday destination, or, well, whatever takes your fancy?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s over a month now since Visual Studio 2005 officially RTM’d, and during that time I’ve been fortunate enough to have been using it for the majority of my time on most working days. One of the things we’re trying to achieve is the integration of several distinct internal corporate web applications into a bespoke portal system, with single sign-on, common authorization model, common look and feel, etc. There’s been quite a heavy R&amp;amp;D / proof-of-concept aspect to the workload so far, as we try out different ways of achieving this, and grow familiar with the new technologies available to us in ASP.NET 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ah, I do enjoy beers by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wychwood.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Wychwood Brewery&lt;/a&gt;, who have a particularly good website (i.e. better than most of the brewery sites I’ve come across so far).  Hobgoblin is an obvious favourite, easily available from any supermarket worth its salt.  Today I sampled their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wychwood.co.uk/wychwood_whirlygig.htm&#34;&gt;Whirlygig&lt;/a&gt; ale, a 4.5% “frenzy of hops and malt”, which really is delicious.  Lots of flavour, lots of character – very enjoyable indeed.  This one goes into the “buy again” column.  Jocelyn didn’t get a look in, so I can’t give you the female opinion, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wednesday night’s tipple was the rather strange 5% ABV &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.k1664.co.uk&#34;&gt;Kronenbourg Blanc&lt;/a&gt;, from UK brewing giant &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A//www.scottish-newcastle.com/&#34;&gt;Scottish &amp;amp; Newcastle&lt;/a&gt;.  Described as a “refreshing, fruity white beer”, this is in fact blatantly piss-coloured (which probably explains why it comes in an opaque bottle).  I found this to be more reminiscent of a weak cider or some kind of bizarre citrus alcopop than anything deserving to have the word “beer” on the label.  Still, try everything once except Morris Dancing and incest, as the saying goes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve used this deliciously elegant result in production J2EE code in the past, but it’s equally valid in C#, &lt;em&gt;as long as you can make the additional assertion that m/n is positive&lt;/em&gt;. This is because whilst Java treats integer division by rounding to zero, &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/6a71f45d%28en-us,vs.80%29.aspx&#34;&gt;C# merely truncates the result&lt;/a&gt; (in an unchecked context). In my experience, the most frequentuse for this result is the deft answering of questions such as “if I have x items in my dataset and I display y per page, how many pages do I have in total?”, where it is obviously safe to make the assertion of a positive result.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some days I feel like I’m spitting in the wind. It amazes me that the following ten concepts, websites and applications aren’t more widely used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed&#34;&gt;RSS Feeds&lt;/a&gt; – why waste your time repeatedly trawling dozens of sites looking for new content?  Let it come to you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/&#34;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; – practically everyone I know has a digital camera, but still relatively few have a Flickr account. Share your photos, don’t keep them unseen on your hard drive!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gmail.com&#34;&gt;GMail&lt;/a&gt; – by far the most effective web-based email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.com/firefox&#34;&gt;FireFox&lt;/a&gt; – if only for the tabbed browsing. But really, it’s so much nicer than IE6, and a myriad of different extensions are available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://microsoft.com/office/onenote&#34;&gt;OneNote&lt;/a&gt; – so much better than scraps of paper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_search&#34;&gt;Desktop Search&lt;/a&gt; – I don’t care &lt;a href=&#34;http://desktop.google.com/&#34;&gt;which&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.copernic.com/en/products/desktop-search/&#34;&gt;desktop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/desktopsearch/&#34;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://desktop.yahoo.com/&#34;&gt;program&lt;/a&gt; you use, but please install one!  You’ll find it so much easier to find old emails and other files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us&#34;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; – access your bookmarks anywhere, and share them with friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypeInfo.mspx&#34;&gt;ClearType&lt;/a&gt; – if you have a flatscreen monitor, you should turn ClearType on. Period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtualpc/default.mspx&#34;&gt;Virtual PC&lt;/a&gt; – there’s no need to test beta software on your main machine, or keep several differently-configured computers around the house any more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/prophoto/synctoy.mspx&#34;&gt;SyncToy&lt;/a&gt; – this is a great little app for synchronizing and backing-up folders; it’s really useful for combining media folders, and for synching files with a portable hard drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it funny how one’s tastes change as maturity progresses?  I used to spend my summer holidays at the sea-side, playing in arcades and seeking the perfect milkshake (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.snackspot.org.uk/thread.php?story=0408101147daa&#34;&gt;lime&lt;/a&gt;); more recently I’ve been spending them in the highlands, playing on the hills and seeking the perfect dram (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scotchwhisky.com/focus/lagavulin.htm&#34;&gt;lagavulin&lt;/a&gt;).  Hmmm…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I may have mentioned that the wife is away in the States for a while.  At the start of this period of solitude, I panicked, wondering whatever I could do with myself, and came to the conclusion that it would be a good idea to buy a computer game to while away the hours.  After all, I spent much of my formative years killing time on a variety of computer and console games, so why not rekindle that prior love affair?  So it was that I bought &lt;a href=&#34;http://thesims2.ea.com/&#34;&gt;The Sims 2&lt;/a&gt;, a truly excellent game, and had an enjoyable evening trying to motivate my wee Sims to improve their skills, better themselves, and generally enjoy life.  All good harmless fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Holy cow, one of the limestone towers at Australia’s Twelve Apostles park has collapsed into the sea!  It was the one in the foreground of the photo to the left. Seeing this fantastic set of rock formations (and flying over them in a helicopter) was one of the many highlights of my vacation to Australia in Dec 2002 / Jan 2003.  You always hear about coastal erosion and the way landscape changes over time, but never really expect significant changes to occur during your own lifetime…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New Recommendations for String Comparisons in .NET 2.0</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know it’s a rather geeky and dry subject, but I found &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dndotnet/html/StringsinNET20.asp&#34;&gt;this MSDN article on new recommendations for using strings in .NET 2.0&lt;/a&gt; quite interesting. It’s going to be difficult to stop using CultureInfo.InvariantCulture habitually!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Up at 0500 yesterday and onto the early GNER Mallard down to that London town for the MSDN briefing on eXtreme programming with .NET. It was pleasant not to be driving for a change, and speeding through the Yorkshire countryside early on a midsummer morning was very relaxing – what a stark contrast with the hot crowded tube that I had to catch on arrival to the big smoke. Three stops down to Oxford Circus seemed to last as long as the entire preceeding train journey. How people do this every single day I do not know..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tech Books</title>

      <guid>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/tech-books/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I succumbed to temptation and bought another book at the MSDN briefing yesterday, pausing only out of concern that the guy who mans the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.computermanuals.co.uk&#34;&gt;Computer Manuals&lt;/a&gt; stand at these events might think that I’m stalking him (or fancy him!). Having determined that I could hand over my Barclaycard whilst flashing my wedding ring, I brought my current reading list up to three:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/078214361X&#34;&gt;Developer to Designer: GUI Design for the Busy Developer&lt;/a&gt; – this was a wedding present from my mother-in-law and is proving to be an interesting, easy-going read so far. My competencies lie in the middle tier and database, and although I’m technically capable of making GUIs, I prefer to leave the design up to others. It’s inevitable though that most coders end up doing some design, and this book is, er, designed (sorry) to help with that process. The early section of the book concentrates on each UI element in turn, whilst the later part of the book looks at putting it all together, and has particular focus on the web – layout design patterns and interaction patterns. It’s a good read, making a nice contrast from the heavier books, and I’m pleased to learn that I’m not alone in hating Outlook’s labyrinthine Tools-&amp;gt;Options dialog!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Keogh has been blogging her &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.livejournal.com/users/sirenian/19432.html&#34;&gt;advice for software-developer apprentices&lt;/a&gt;, and recommends buying and reading a selection of good software development books. I think this is sound advice – personally I felt that my career and abilities starting taking off when I stopped reading tech-specific Wrox tomes that were obsolete within six months of publication and started buying timeless Addison-Wesley hardbacks. Why so many newbie coders insist on rediscovering solutions to well-known problems instead of leveraging the knowledge of our programming forebears is beyond me, but most of us have behaved in this way at some point. Give yourself a leg-up and read some decent software design books.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Framework for Persisting .NET Classes Into SQL Server Image Fields, With Locking Ability</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There seems to have been a lack of .NET-related stuff on this blog recently, so let me show you something I cobbled together for work purposes last Wednesday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common requirement we have in our ASP.NET applications is how to reliably persist object instances for a lengthy period of time. End users shouldn’t have to concern themselves with the concept of Session expiry, and it’s unacceptable for them to return to their PC after nipping off for a coffee to be confronted with the dreaded &amp;ldquo;Object reference not set to an instance of an object&amp;rdquo; when they try to continue editing their basket / sales order / timesheet / whatever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Generic Sorter For Strongly-Typed Collections</title>
      <link>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/a-generic-sorter-for-strongly-typed-collections/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2004 21:11:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/a-generic-sorter-for-strongly-typed-collections/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Late last night I was doing some development work on a website for our investment club. I had a strongly-typed collection of &amp;ldquo;Stock&amp;rdquo; objects, and wanted to be able to sort them on any parameter (StockName, SharePrice, Volume, MarketCap, etc..) in either descending or ascending order. I didn’t want to have to write a separate comparer for each property. Reflection to the rescue! Below is a GenericSorter class, the use of which allows for the development of a Sort() method on the collection taking as a parameter the name of the property on which to sort. Smart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is My String Empty?  Some C# Performance Metrics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (25/02/2006)&lt;/strong&gt; – Hey, we now have &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/string-isnullorempty/&#34;&gt;String.IsNullOrEmpty&lt;/a&gt;, you know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the quickest way, in C#, to test whether a string is empty?  This is a question which came to my mind yesterday. I’ve always been fond of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but it occured to me that this necessitates the creation and destruction of a second object (the empty string with which we’re comparing), so maybe it would be quicker to write:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Inheriting From BaseValidator to Make Custom Validation Controls</title>

      <guid>https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/inheriting-from-basevalidator-to-make-custom-validation-controls/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For months now, I’ve been desperate for a decent excuse to make a custom ASP.NET server control, so I was secretly pleased today when a CustomValidator originally coded for use on a single page was required elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s surprisingly easy to do, although it took me a while to find a decent example online, which eventually came courtesy of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/webtech/tips/t040302-1.shtml&#34;&gt;4GuysFromRolla&lt;/a&gt;. In my particular scenario, I needed to check that the text entered into a TextBox did not equal any of a selection of &amp;ldquo;banned&amp;rdquo; strings (which was available via a static property on another class).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;“You seem to be going awfully fast,” said the perspiring southern lady on the footpath to Stac Pollaidh, “would you pull me up?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I smiled politely, but in reality I was both shocked and pleased to have realised that over the course of the week, my mental and physical fitness &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; increased, and here I was, alone, practically jogging towards the impressive sight that is Stac Pollaidh.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I first wandered up the long track toward Beinn Dearg a year ago, when Daffy insisted we leave it at an early stage and clamber up through snow-covered heather onto a large rounded ridge which seemed to go on forever before finally nearing the summit of Eididh nan Clach Geala. Fortunately no such deviations were ordered this year, which was just as well since I was on strangely good form viz-a-viz walking, and enjoyed setting a pace up the stream-crossed path until it eventually disappeared, at which point I reverted to my more familiar snail’s pace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sunday a handful of us bagged Ben Wyvis, where apparently Martin Moran was avalanched during his record breaking winter munro expedition.  Our trip up to the top was thankfully less life-threatening, with the only dangers coming from the many snowball fights, or riding over rocks during the pitifully slow bum-slide back to the soggy foothills.  But the sun was out in force, as were the views.  It was a good start to the holiday proper, and served as a gentle reminder how unfit I am, as I soon found myself lagging behind all and sundry during the ascent.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Boy, do I let myself in for some exhausting pastimes. I could have spent the day at home, slumped in front of the web, but nope, not today. Gulvain is a right royal pain. A “shy hill”, according to the books, which basically means you have to walk for miles before you reach its foot. Then you have a steep walk upwards before reaching what, admittedly, is a fairly enjoyable ridge. Or at least I imagine it would be were it possible to see more then a few metres ahead of you. Seeing a trig point emerging out of the mist on an otherwise barren landscape is quite a spooky experience – I felt vaguely akin to one of the monkeys at the start of &lt;em&gt;2001 – A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, surrounding that vast solid pillar inquisitively. But there wasn’t time to peruse on this for too long, as the evening was drawing in and we had a date to keep in Ullapool.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Brucey’s protective, cautionary side does not show itself often, but it’s undoubtedly there. One of his female housemates once commented that “he really looks after us in the flat, he’s like the Dad of the house!” and I can now sort of imagine how this is true. I get the feeling people are likely to misrepresent him as being some kind of mad Scottish loony, especially when up on the munros, risking his life for the sake of a quick bag or a bit of a laugh, but I’m beginning to think that under the “ker-azy” exterior, he’s alarmingly sensible. Posit: we’re at the bottom of a gorgeous snow-covered gully on Buachaille Etive Mor, and I’m gagging to don some crampons (lent to me by the man himself), and get going. But Brucey has other ideas:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I still can’t quite believe that we all woke up at 6:30am on a Saturday.  But evidently it happened.  The journey up to Killin was fantastic, truly amazing.  All the floods, cloud, and rain had been left behind in England – we had clear open skies and sunny snow-topped peaks.  Bruce quickly ran out of superlatives, and decided to start inventing more, declaring this to be a ‘riptastic’ day.  We had to park up occasionally during the journey to take more photos, the scenery was just so fine.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;More rain. Can you spot a pattern, dear reader? So we sped over to the western highlands and bagged a couple of munros near Bridge of Orchy, close to our rendezvous with Bruce. I actually quite enjoyed myself, but don’t tell anybody…&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really not fit enough for this lark.  As Rich later said, “Nel has invented a pace between stop and walk.”  But at least I give it a go and get away from the PC once in a while.  Can’t get much further away from it than Ben Macdui – just a shame we didn’t reach the summit until almost dusk.  Oopsy.  By the time we got to the bothy it was pitch darkness, and the bothy was full of people who showed no intentions of squeezing up.  So after some chicken soup and bread (supplementing the two Mars Bars we had already eaten that day – bloaters or what?) we got into sleeping bags and survival bags for a rather damp night’s sleep.  The first time I’ve ever worn a woolley hat while sleeping, and hopefully the last.  Oh well, at least it didn’t rain.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
