<p>Don’t just take our word for it! Listen to the experiences of other satisfied customers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Ian is one of the most hard working and professional individuals that I have had the pleasure to work with. His methodical approach allows him to digest the problem put before him prior to making a reasoned and rational suggestion.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ian’s development skills and knowledge were able to cope with every challenge, identifying one or more solutions for every scenario that I put forward as Product Owner. This then allowed me to then pick the best solution for the project.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ian is a consummate team player and worked efficiently and effectively with the other members of the development team. He always made himself available for me to ask questions to help me understand the technical aspect of a story. Ian’s expertise and problem solving skills have helped to drive the project forward and I am extremely grateful for the contribution that he has made. He will be greatly missed, not just by me, but by the whole of the team.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Robin Hackshall, Senior Information Analyst, <a href="http://www.ic.nhs.uk/">Health and Social Care Information Centre</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Ian is able to take high-level business requirements and swiftly design and produce a set of solid, scalable, and efficient systems, and with meticulous attention to detail. Ian’s grasp of agile tools, design patterns, and NHibernate in particular are masterful, and I would recommend him without hesitation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Ashfaq Hussain, Freelance Application Developer, <a href="http://www.ic.nhs.uk/">Health and Social Care Information Centre</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Impressed how quickly you’ve done this. Take the rest of the week off.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Paul Campbell, Director, <a href="http://www.decoratedworld.co.uk/">Decorated World</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Ian worked on a particularly troublesome project for me for eight months at NHS Choices without complaint. His development skills and knowledge are exemplary and his NHibernate knowledge is second to none. He worked well with all the members of the team and helped me to introduce pair programming and push the test driven development agenda. I will employ Ian whenever I have the chance.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Nick Porthouse, Development Manager, <a href="http://www.nhs.uk">NHS Choices</a></p>
