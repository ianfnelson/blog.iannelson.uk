We find ourselves wandering round stately piles quite often, in an effort to Bentertain the one year old. Driving license. North Yorkshire County Libraries card. Libraries gave us power! ‚ÄúLoyalty‚Äù cards from Boots, Shell, WHSmith, Coop, Tesco and Nectar. I‚Äôm not very loyal, but I don‚Äôt look a gift horse in the mouth. And that‚Äôs your lot.
