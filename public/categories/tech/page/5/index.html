    <p>I’m off to the MSDN Technical roadshow in Harrogate tomorrow, and am actually really looking forward to it this time. These events are free, so always well worth attending when they’re local, but some years are certainly better than others – it mostly depends on the material being covered. I remember one year circa 2003-4, when .NET was well established, but before the Whidbey release, so the majority of the day was effectively just a sales pitch covering elementary .NET concepts, presumably for those laggards who hadn’t yet made the great leap from VB6. Another data-binding demo, anybody? Yawn.

    <p>I am now a Microsoft Certified Solution Developer in .NET 1.x technologies. This is a qualification that I’ve been working towards on and (more often than not) off for the past four years or so. It’s not really the case that the exams were super-hard, just that it took occasional motivation to get round to taking them!
So, was it worth it? Did I learn anything en route? Did the exams boost my employability? Would I be more inclined to employ someone with an MCSD than an applicant without?

    <p>Having accepted that Returning DataSets from WebServices is the Spawn of Satan and Represents All That Is Truly Evil in the World (or at least, not exactly best practice), I’ve been trying to make a conscious effort to instead use lightweight custom objects in my middle tier, to be exposed via web services for use by other applications. I felt sure that some of the new Generic classes in the .NET 2.0 FCL would help me in my quest. Specifically, as I often need to expose simple arrays of Key/Value Pair metadata, I planned to create an instance of the System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection class, containing a bunch of System.Collections.Generic.KeyValuePair objects. ...</p>

    <p>As I mentioned last summer, I do enjoy whiling away a few hours attempting to solve the maths / progamming challenges set on Project Euler. My language of choice for most puzzles is C#, but this hampered me on some of the questions as there is no in-built support for really big integers.
However, a little bit of Googling and I came across this excellent BigInteger class on Code Project which does everything I need and more – and it seems bloody fast, too. Thanks to this class, I’ve been able to knock off several more problems this weekend, and now have a rating of “11% Genius” – still some way to go, then…

    <p>Back in November 2004, I had the idea of making a “Generic Sorter for Strongly-Typed Collections”, by harnessing the mighty power of reflection. Well, earlier this month somebody anonymously emailed me some code that takes this to a whole different level, enabling sorting on multiple properties and to arbitrary depths within the domain model hierarchy, all by taking a single SQL-like parameter. It’s really very clever indeed, and I’m going to use this method in the future – thanks, anonymous code fairy!

Well, as of .NET 2.0, we have a new static method on the System.String class – IsNullOrEmpty – that allows you to easily test whether a string is, well, null or empty!

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Rounding Up The Result of Integer Division
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Here’s a damn useful piece of information which should be in the armoury of every modern codemonkey:
In Java, if it is required to round up the result of dividing m by n (where m and n are integers), one should compute (m&#43;n-1)/n
Source: Number Conversion, Roland Backhouse, 2001
I’ve used this deliciously elegant result in production J2EE code in the past, but it’s equally valid in C#, as long as you can make the additional assertion that m/n is positive. This is because whilst Java treats integer division by rounding to zero, C# merely truncates the result (in an unchecked context). In my experience, the most frequentuse for this result is the deft answering of questions such as “if I have x items in my dataset and I display y per page, how many pages do I have in total?”, where it is obviously safe to make the assertion of a positive result.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Some days I feel like I’m spitting in the wind. It amazes me that the following ten concepts, websites and applications aren’t more widely used:
RSS Feeds – why waste your time repeatedly trawling dozens of sites looking for new content? Let it come to you! Flickr – practically everyone I know has a digital camera, but still relatively few have a Flickr account. Share your photos, don’t keep them unseen on your hard drive! GMail – by far the most effective web-based email. FireFox – if only for the tabbed browsing. But really, it’s so much nicer than IE6, and a myriad of different extensions are available. OneNote – so much better than scraps of paper. Desktop Search – I don’t care which desktop search program you use, but please install one! You’ll find it so much easier to find old emails and other files. del.icio.us – access your bookmarks anywhere, and share them with friends. ClearType – if you have a flatscreen monitor, you should turn ClearType on. Period. Virtual PC – there’s no need to test beta software on your main machine, or keep several differently-configured computers around the house any more! SyncToy – this is a great little app for synchronizing and backing-up folders; it’s really useful for combining media folders, and for synching files with a portable hard drive. </p>

    <p>Isn’t it funny how one’s tastes change as maturity progresses? I used to spend my summer holidays at the sea-side, playing in arcades and seeking the perfect milkshake (lime); more recently I’ve been spending them in the highlands, playing on the hills and seeking the perfect dram (lagavulin). Hmmm…
I think I may have mentioned that the wife is away in the States for a while. At the start of this period of solitude, I panicked, wondering whatever I could do with myself, and came to the conclusion that it would be a good idea to buy a computer game to while away the hours. After all, I spent much of my formative years killing time on a variety of computer and console games, so why not rekindle that prior love affair? So it was that I bought The Sims 2, a truly excellent game, and had an enjoyable evening trying to motivate my wee Sims to improve their skills, better themselves, and generally enjoy life. All good harmless fun.

    <p>I know it’s a rather geeky and dry subject, but I found this MSDN article on new recommendations for using strings in .NET 2.0 quite interesting. It’s going to be difficult to stop using CultureInfo.InvariantCulture habitually!

    <p>Up at 0500 yesterday and onto the early GNER Mallard down to that London town for the MSDN briefing on eXtreme programming with .NET. It was pleasant not to be driving for a change, and speeding through the Yorkshire countryside early on a midsummer morning was very relaxing – what a stark contrast with the hot crowded tube that I had to catch on arrival to the big smoke. Three stops down to Oxford Circus seemed to last as long as the entire preceeding train journey. How people do this every single day I do not know..

    <p>I succumbed to temptation and bought another book at the MSDN briefing yesterday, pausing only out of concern that the guy who mans the Computer Manuals stand at these events might think that I’m stalking him (or fancy him!). Having determined that I could hand over my Barclaycard whilst flashing my wedding ring, I brought my current reading list up to three:
Developer to Designer: GUI Design for the Busy Developer – this was a wedding present from my mother-in-law and is proving to be an interesting, easy-going read so far. My competencies lie in the middle tier and database, and although I’m technically capable of making GUIs, I prefer to leave the design up to others. It’s inevitable though that most coders end up doing some design, and this book is, er, designed (sorry) to help with that process. The early section of the book concentrates on each UI element in turn, whilst the later part of the book looks at putting it all together, and has particular focus on the web – layout design patterns and interaction patterns. It’s a good read, making a nice contrast from the heavier books, and I’m pleased to learn that I’m not alone in hating Outlook’s labyrinthine Tools-&gt;Options dialog!
