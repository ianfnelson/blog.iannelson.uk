      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2022, in a bid to outwit my mother in our daily Wordle battles, I wrote some C# code to explore optimal starting guesses. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/the-best-wordle-starter-words/&#34;&gt;You can read about that experiment here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward two years, and my Wordle addiction is alive and well. The daily challenge remains as compelling as ever, but it’s the family WhatsApp group – where scores are shared, victories boasted, and failures commiserated – that adds an extra layer of fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2022, in a bid to outwit my mother in our daily Wordle battles, I wrote some C# code to explore optimal starting guesses. <a href="https://blog.iannelson.uk/the-best-wordle-starter-words/">You can read about that experiment here</a>.</p>
<p>Fast forward two years, and my Wordle addiction is alive and well. The daily challenge remains as compelling as ever, but it’s the family WhatsApp group – where scores are shared, victories boasted, and failures commiserated – that adds an extra layer of fun.</p>
<p>As 2024 winds down, I decided to dust off my coding skills and whip up a quick C# console application. The goal? To parse an export of our WhatsApp chat, gather all the shared Wordle scores, and find out if my strategies have paid off this year. Spoiler alert: they haven’t.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a similar Wordle-centric group chat with family or friends and fancy crowning your own Wordle Champion of the Year, the source code is available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ianfnelson/WordleParser">WordleParser</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>
<p>The application takes a single argument: the path to an exported chat text file. It parses the file using a <a href="https://github.com/ianfnelson/WordleParser/blob/main/WordleParser/WordleParser.cs#L46">regular expression</a> to extract anything resembling a Wordle score. <a href="https://github.com/ianfnelson/WordleParser/blob/main/WordleParser/WordleParser.cs#L27">Duplicate scores are weeded out</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/ianfnelson/WordleParser/blob/main/WordleParser/WordleParser.cs#L32">average family score for each calendar day is logged</a>. For those unfortunate days when a puzzle remains unsolved, the application <a href="https://github.com/ianfnelson/WordleParser/blob/main/WordleParser/WordleParser.cs#L59">assigns a ‘seven’</a> to reflect the failure.</p>
<p>The app then aggregates scores into calendar <a href="https://github.com/ianfnelson/WordleParser/blob/main/WordleParser/WordleParser.cs#L17">months</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ianfnelson/WordleParser/blob/main/WordleParser/WordleParser.cs#L11">years</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ianfnelson/WordleParser/blob/main/WordleParser/WordleParser.cs#L76">calculating each family member’s stats for the chosen date range</a>. Participants are ranked based on their mean difference from the average family score per day.</p>
<p>For example, if three family members scored a 4, but one managed a dazzling 2, the day’s average would be 3.5. The three “fours” would each have a daily difference of +0.5, while the lucky “two” would boast a difference of -1.5.</p>
<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>
<p>So, who triumphed in the Nelson family Wordle-off this year? Did my painstaking analysis from 2022 finally give me the edge?</p>
<p>Reader, it did not.</p>
<p>Despite my best efforts, I only just managed to sneak into second place. Predictably, my mother reigned supreme, crushing us all with an average score of <strong>4.055</strong> and a mean difference from the family average of <strong>-0.128</strong>. This consistency made her our undisputed <strong>Wordle Family Champion of 2024</strong>.</p>

<p>I spent a good ten minutes this evening reading Isla a Ladybird book about Vikings. Their culture, food, tools where they came from, etc. The last page posed the question “What would you do if you were a Viking?”</p>
<p>Isla considered this briefly, then suggested “Play ‘Angry Birds’?”</p>

<p>Ben: “Hey Dad, in about three more birthdays you’ll be nearly 40”<br>
Me: “That’s right Ben. It’s a bit scary really.”<br>

scared. ‘Cos you’ll be closer to dying.”</p>

Ben: “Well, for the undeep bit it’s a…”<br>
Me: “The what? The undie bit?”<br>
Ben: “The UNDEEP bit of the pool.”<br>
Me: “Oh, I see – we call that the ‘shallow’ end.”<br>
Ben: “OK. For the shallow bit of the pool it’s a lady. For the unshallow bit it’s a man.”</p>

<p>Isla: “Daddy, what are manners?”<br>

<p>Even at bedtime, and even when utterly misheard – if one child asks for something, their sibling demands it too. Case in point:</p>

<p>Isla shouted for me twice in the night, complaining that she was being plagued by “fairy bumblebees” that were trying to peel her skin off.<br>
During the day today, I quizzed her as to why she shouted for me and not Jocelyn Nelson.<br>
“Because you’re better at it,” she told me.<br>
“Better at what?” I asked.<br>
“Killing the fairy bumblebees!” she replied.</p>

Me: “Do you mean a Raspberry Pi?”<br>
Ben: “Yeah!”</p>

<p>Ben: “I guess they had a Wii when they were younger and played the Snow Resort bit of ‘Go Vacation’ a lot!”</p>

<p>Me: “Good morning Matthew!”<br>
Matthew: “Poo.”</p>
<p>Ah wonderful, we’ve taught another one to communicate.</p>

<p>Ben’s homework was to write sentences containing a comparative adjective and a connective. He came up with the following:</p>
<p>“Mum is old but Dad is older.”</p>
<p>Hmmm…</p>

<p>Ben’s homework – think of ten verbs and write sentences containing them.</p>

<hr>
<p>I went into Ben’s room to find that 21-month old Matthew had managed to climb up into Ben’s high-sleeper cabin bed.</p>
<p>“Matthew Henry, how did you get up there?!” I asked with mock exasperation.</p>
<p>He looked at me as if I were an imbecile, pointed and slowly said<br>
“Ladder!”</p>

<p>When the broken printer that I offered on FreeCycle failed to garner any interest:</p>
<p>Ben: “Ah Dad, why don’t you say how good it<br>

<p>Matthew: “Momma – more chips, please?”</p>
<p>It’s amazing what polite linguistics one-year-olds are capable of given sufficient incentive.</p>
<p><em>July 2014</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Isla: “¡Hola! Konichiwa! Edinburgh rock!”</p>
<p>One week in to our vacation, Isla’s Spanish is still somewhat lacking.<br>
Ben, meanwhile, has mastered “patatas fritas” so he’ll survive.</p>

<p>Saturday morning, 0645. It seems Matthew is slightly obsessed with the 90-second long theme tune at the end of contemporary Thomas The Tank Engine episodes.</p>
<p>“Dadda, more choo-choo! Song! Crew!” (Hits me with remote control)</p>

<p>At home we keep a bunch of Thomas The Tank Engine track inside a large footstool. Here’s a photo of a frustrated Matthew discovering that not all footstools in the universe possess this property. “Track!!!”</p>
<p><em>August 2014</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Me: “Isla, your bagel is ready!”<br>
Matthew runs into the kitchen.<br>
Me: “You’re not Isla. You’re Matthew.”<br>
Isla walks into the kitchen.<br>
Isla: “I’m Isla.”<br>
Matthew turns, pushes his sister.<br>
Matthew: “YOU ARE NOT ISLA! I AM ISLA!”</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m on a break between contracts this week, so decided to make the most of the good weather and headed into the Peak District to revisit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stanageedge.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Stanage Edge&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/stanage-edge/&#34;&gt;my last visit twenty years ago&lt;/a&gt;, there were no ropes or belays involved this time. Instead my Mum and I had a leisurely wander in the blistering July sunshine up part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Causeway&#34;&gt;Long Causeway&lt;/a&gt;, before taking some snapshots at the latest version of the historic &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/visiting/places-to-visit/stanage-and-north-lees/stanage-pole&#34;&gt;Stanage Pole&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Scrambling with Isla on Saddleworth Moor</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My daughter Isla pronounced &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/pen-y-ghent/&#34;&gt;our April walk up Pen-y-Ghent&lt;/a&gt; to have been “a bit boring”. Apparently she enjoyed the scrambling and the views but not the lengthy slog. Fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, looking for something more interesting for our next Dad and Daughter trip into the hills, I armed myself with a copy of “&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2T398tt&#34;&gt;Scrambles In The Dark Peak&lt;/a&gt;” by Terry Sleaford and Tom Corker, and today we set off to tackle the first route in the book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Starting at a lay-by high on Saddleworth Moor, we dropped down into Rimmon Pit Clough, before scrambling up again to the Raven Stones and The Trinnacle.</p>
<p>The route back to the road was mostly a gradual climb across open moorland – tiring work for middle-aged legs that made the overall walk feel much longer than its eight kilometres!

      <title>Pen-y-ghent With a Daughter</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lovely spring Sunday walk up Pen-y-ghent in the Yorkshire Dales with my daughter Isla (her first hike up a proper hill).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was most liberating to get out into the hills after so many months stuck at home or staying local due to the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Temperature Blanket – A Rare Opportunity for My Coding to Assist Jocelyn&#39;s Crafting</title>
      <link>https://blog.iannelson.uk/temperature-blanket/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2020 22:35:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the resident geek in our family, it won’t surprise you to hear that I am occasionally approached by Jocelyn and our kids to provide tech support. Sadly, most of these queries are invariably of the “how do I print from my phone” or “the Sky box stopped working” ilk, and rarely trouble my software skills. So it came as a pleasant surprise when I recently encountered a genuine reason to use .NET, APIs and Docker in support of one of Jocelyn’s craft projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the resident geek in our family, it won’t surprise you to hear that I am occasionally approached by Jocelyn and our kids to provide tech support. Sadly, most of these queries are invariably of the “how do I print from my phone” or “the Sky box stopped working” ilk, and rarely trouble my software skills. So it came as a pleasant surprise when I recently encountered a genuine reason to use .NET, APIs and Docker in support of one of Jocelyn’s craft projects.</p>
<p>Jocelyn has embarked on crocheting a <em>Temperature Blanket</em> throughout 2020. This will consist of 366 squares, one for each day of this leap year, in colours corresponding to the minimum, maximum and average temperatures that we experienced on that day.</p>
<p>And here was the rub – a notable absence of websites that provided these three daily data points for a location close to home. Some sites only had minimum and maximum, but no average. Others considered a “day” to run from, say, 4am to 4am, rather than midnight to midnight, which just isn’t in the spirit of the project. Still others offered the data points she needed, but not for any place close to home.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’m looking forward to some violet days<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Here was my opportunity to help and earn some husbandly brownie points! I already had an account for the excellent <a href="https://darksky.net/dev">Dark Sky API</a>, which offers forecast and historical weather data by latitude and longitude. Further, <a href="https://www.adamweiss.me/">Adam Weiss</a> has made available <a href="https://github.com/amweiss/dark-sky-core">dark-sky-core</a>, a .NET Standard Nuget Package for accessing this API from .NET code. I fired up Rider, started a new console app, bashed out the following quick function, and proudly presented the desired figures to Mrs Nelson.</p>
<p>Scope creep inevitably presented itself at this point, as a console application didn’t meet UX requirements.</p>
<p><em>“That’s great Ian – now can you get it to email me the figures every day?”</em></p>
<p>Hmm. I didn’t want to get into <em>that</em>, but I could do one better, and make this into a simple self-service dedicated website. I launched a new Rider instance and created a boilerplate ASP.NET website to show the desired temperatures for the preceding 28 days. I added a standard Dockerfile, built and pushed a container image, and deployed it to an Azure App Service Plan. The final touch was to configure a memorable subdomain and so it was that <a href="http://blanket.iannelson.uk">http://blanket.iannelson.uk</a> was born.</p>
<p>The (rough and ready) source code for both the console application and web version can be found on GitHub:</p>

      <title>Scotland With A Son – Into The Highlands With My 10 Year Old</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-one-saturday-26th-may-2018&#34;&gt;Day One – Saturday 26th May 2018&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty years after bagging my first Munro – the dreary &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/meall-a-chrasgaidh/&#34;&gt;Meall a’ Chrasgaidh&lt;/a&gt; – and somehow developing an affinity for the Great Scottish Outdoors, I found myself heading northwards once again. Not this time in the company of my university friends, but instead with a ten-year-old boy in tow, namely my eldest Son, Benjamin. It was half-term holiday, he had just finished SATs, and I was hoping to prise him away from screens for a few days and to pass on some of my latent enthusiasm for the Highlands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="day-one-saturday-26th-may-2018">Day One – Saturday 26th May 2018</h3>
<p>Twenty years after bagging my first Munro – the dreary <a href="https://blog.iannelson.uk/meall-a-chrasgaidh/">Meall a’ Chrasgaidh</a> – and somehow developing an affinity for the Great Scottish Outdoors, I found myself heading northwards once again. Not this time in the company of my university friends, but instead with a ten-year-old boy in tow, namely my eldest Son, Benjamin. It was half-term holiday, he had just finished SATs, and I was hoping to prise him away from screens for a few days and to pass on some of my latent enthusiasm for the Highlands.</p>
<p>The journey took longer than I expected. We departed home around 1030 and reached Killin by 1700. Google helped us avoid two traffic jams, a technology that hadn’t existed on my earliest Scottish trips in 1998 (nor, for that matter, did the A74(M)’s parenthetical M). We were staying at the <a href="http://www.bridgeoflochay.co.uk/">Bridge of Lochay Hotel</a>, and after a pleasant evening meal there we took a drive down the road between <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/perthshire/ben-lawers.shtml">Ben Lawers</a> and the Bridge of Balgie, where we saw a bewildering number of wild campers.</p>
<p>Back at the hotel, we got Scrabble out. Showing no mercy against my opponent’s tender years, I played all seven tiles on one round to spell ALBUMEN and turn EATING into BEATING, scoring 75 points.

<h3 id="day-two-sunday-27th-may-2018">Day Two – Sunday, 27th May 2018</h3>
<p>I was cognisant that if I was to make the trip a success and a happy memory for Ben (and thus encourage him to want to return), there was no point dragging him up some featureless 3,000-footers. Instead I had planned a whistle-stop tour of the Highlands’ best views, with some fun touristy activities thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>The first of these activities was a trip to <a href="https://goape.co.uk/locations/aberfoyle">Go Ape</a> at Aberfoyle, which culminated with a stunning 45-metre-high, 426-metre-long zipwire flight followed by a bottle of Irn Bru.</p>
<p>Refreshed, we headed up the nearby <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/lochlomond/ben-aan.shtml">Ben A’an</a>, at 454m one of the most popular and picturesque wee hills in Scotland. The weather was unseasonably fine, and we were offered glorious views across the Trossachs.</p>
<p>We left Ben A’an car park around 1700. Ben dozed off in the car, and we reached our accommodation at the legendary <a href="https://clachaig.com/">Clachaig Inn</a> by 1840. By this late hour and following our earlier exertions Ben was super tired and hangry – reluctant to eat but perked up noticeably after having done so. I realised that a quieter day was probably in order for the following day.

<h3 id="day-three-monday-28th-may-2018">Day Three – Monday, 28th May 2018</h3>
<p>A quieter day than Sunday. Initially Ben was adamant that he wanted to do more walk<br>
ing (Ben A’an having whet his appetite for views), so we intended to wander up the <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/fortwilliam/lostvalley.shtml">Lost Valley of Glencoe</a>. But upon reaching the car park, he declared that he did not feel well enough for a hike – something that has happened to me on more than one occasion! So instead we went up the nearby <a href="https://www.nevisrange.co.uk/activities/mountain-gondola/">Nevis Range Mountain Gondola</a> on the north face of <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/munros/aonach-mor">Aonach Mor</a>. The sun was beaming down again, a far cry from the whiteout conditions that I had experienced on 25th November 2000 when my friends and I had to abandon an attempt to reach the Aonach Mor summit from nearby Aonach Beag.</p>
<p>Back down to the car, and with Ben still not in the mood for activity, we took a long drive around Ardnamurchan – Glenuig, Strontian (location of the discovery of Strontium, as I boringly explained to Ben in typical Dad fashion), and back via the Corran Ferry. I resisted the small temptation to take a short but lengthy detour down the narrow tracks to <a href="https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/kilchoan/ardnamurchanpoint/index.html">Ardnamurchan Point</a>, having fallen into that trap on a previous jaunt at August Bank Holiday 2002. Despite this, the relative lack of civilisation for miles around was not lost on us as we struggled to find a convenient place to stop for a bite of lunch. I vowed to learn this lesson on subsequent days, stocking up the car with sandwiches and snacks at the start of the day rather than risk a hungry and grumpy pre-teen companion.</p>
<p>In the evening we sat outside the Clachaig playing chess. We heard tell of a couple of other tourists who had required medical attention after being up on a ridge with too little water and no sunhats. After this it was easier on subsequent days to persuade Ben to wear his own sunhat.

<h3 id="day-four-tuesday-29th-may-2018">Day Four – Tuesday, 29th May 2018</h3>
<p>A lot of driving, unfortunately. I had forgotten how long it can take to get from A to B in the Highlands sometimes. After stopping in Fort William for sandwiches and a pack of playing cards we headed for the picture postcard <a href="https://www.eileandonancastle.com/">Eilean Donan Castle</a>. Here the increasing popularity (and potential Disneyfication) of the Highlands began to hit me. I have photographs from 2002 wherein my friends and I were the only visitors to an otherwise deserted EDC. No longer – extended car and coach parks and additional visitor infrastructure were now in place to accommodate the hoards of tourists.</p>
<p>We enjoyed an ice cream each in the stifling heat before driving up to Plockton, passing the alarming sight of a wildfire in its early stages en route. We later learned that an electrical transformer had exploded, igniting part of the tinder-dry Strathellen Wood. After a quick drink in <a href="https://plocktonhotel.co.uk/">The Plockton Hotel</a> we boarded the legendary <a href="https://calums-sealtrips.com/">Calum’s Seal Trip</a>, without which no trip to the north west would be complete. Apart from ourselves, the boat was filled with Italian tourists, who laughed politely at Calum’s gags, which have not changed at all in the last twenty years. One of the staff explained to me that Scotland has become more popular than ever with foreign visitors in recent years, and attempted to convince those same foreign guests that the inexplicably brilliant 2018 weather was typical for the location and time of year.</p>
<p>We stayed at a very pleasant and peaceful <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/6501251">AirBnB by the name of Fasgro in Drumbuie</a>. Our host, Carol, recommended an evening coastal walk, which turned out to be one of my highlights of the entire trip.

<h3 id="day-five-wednesday-30th-may-2018">Day Five – Wednesday, 30th May 2018</h3>
<p>We left Drumbuie, passed through Lochcarron, and headed up the Bealach na Ba pass, which was a much easier drive in the summer months than winter snows. For one thing there were no angry van drivers to wind their windows down as we passed and inexplicably yell at me for being a “bloody fool”. Scottish hospitality has definitely improved.</p>
<p>After parking up, we took advantage of our high altitude to wander up to the transmitter station, then over to the 792m Corbett <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/torridon/Sgurrachaorachain.shtml">Sgurr a’ Chaorachain</a>. I thought this was an easy walk with cracking views over to Skye and Raasay. But Ben was hard work, complaining every step of the way and having to be bribed to continue (I placed Amazon orders for new XBox games from the Corbett summit!). I was unsure why he disliked this walk compared to the steeper exertions of Ben A’an earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Back to the car, and we drove through the majestic <a href="https://www.nts.org.uk/visit/places/torridon">Torridon</a>, Kinlochewe (stopped for another ice cream), and on to the <a href="http://www.aultguish.co.uk/">Aultguish Inn</a>. There has clearly been some capital investment here, as the room facilities had improved immeasurably since my visits in the earliest years of the century.

<h3 id="day-six-thursday-31st-may-2018">Day Six – Thursday, 31st May 2018</h3>
<p>Ben was sick in the night, explaining his lack of enthusiasm on the hills the previous day. We abandoned plans to scramble up <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/ullapool/stacpollaidh.shtml">Stac Pollaidh</a>, and instead opted for more driving – a big circular route around the far north. We saw Durness, Tongue, and some wonderful coastal scenes along the A836 across the very top of the country, before reaching the anticlimactic John O’Groats where we bought some soft toys and sweets as gifts for Ben’s siblings. Our journey back down the eastern seaboard was shrouded in thick fog, depriving us of any seascape views.</p>
<p>In the evening we played card games in the hotel bar, by which time Ben was on much better form, thrashing my exhausted self at most games and feeling well enough to devour the biggest dessert on the menu.</p>
<p>After Ben retired to our room to watch some TV talent show, I got chatting to a pleasant young bohemian lady, who had recently embarked on an attempted continuous round of the Munros, travelling between them on bicycle. I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t slightly envious of her freedom and ability to take so much time out of the rat race for such an endeavour. But conversely, I was happy to have had a Son in tow with whom to share a brief week experiencing some of the many delights that Scotland has to offer to all ages.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Benny George, our precocious two-year-old, is quite the fan of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/mistermaker/&#34;&gt;Mister Maker&lt;/a&gt;, and enjoys spending time doing arty crafty stuff with his mum. Now, the great thing about the BBC is that they tend to suggest projects which can be created using bits and bobs that you’re likely to have around the home – old cereal boxes and the like. But occasionally some specialist resources have to be procured in the name of Ben’s art, and so it was that Joce today spent £1.99 on a pack of the “googly eyes” so beloved of Maker.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Benny George, our precocious two-year-old, is quite the fan of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/mistermaker/">Mister Maker</a>, and enjoys spending time doing arty crafty stuff with his mum. Now, the great thing about the BBC is that they tend to suggest projects which can be created using bits and bobs that you’re likely to have around the home – old cereal boxes and the like. But occasionally some specialist resources have to be procured in the name of Ben’s art, and so it was that Joce today spent £1.99 on a pack of the “googly eyes” so beloved of Maker.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s the thing though – I couldn’t help but noticing that these 20mm googly eyes come in packs of <em>seventeen</em>. Joce charitably suggested that this was simply the number of eyes that could fit in the packet, but I am more cynical. Can it really be a coincidence that <em>eyes</em> – which are surely generally found in pairs – are sold in an odd quantity, forcing the purchaser to buy slightly more than they required?</p>
<p>And we’re not just looking at an odd number here – 17 is prime too, so even if you happened to be creating models of, say, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatara">the three-eyed Tuatara lizard</a>, you’re still going to end up with some product left over or feel obliged to buy another pack.</p>
<p>Cunning folk, these googly eye marketers, and it makes me wonder why other manufacturers stick to selling their products in multiples of integers with many divisors. Ease of packaging, perhaps.</p>
<p>What other products are sold in prime quantities?</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It gives me the utmost pleasure to announce the birth of Miss Isla Grace Nelson.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a ludicrously speedy labour, Isla entered the world in an ambulance on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://maps.google.co.uk/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=53.907916,-1.18456&amp;amp;spn=0.00273,0.006673&amp;amp;z=17&#34;&gt;eastbound A64 near Bilbrough services&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday 28th April at 18:09 local time (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=28&amp;amp;month=4&amp;amp;year=2009&amp;amp;hour=18&amp;amp;min=9&amp;amp;sec=0&amp;amp;p1=136&#34;&gt;see this time in your time zone&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Following a ludicrously speedy labour, Isla entered the world in an ambulance on the <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=53.907916,-1.18456&amp;spn=0.00273,0.006673&amp;z=17">eastbound A64 near Bilbrough services</a> on Tuesday 28th April at 18:09 local time (<a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=28&amp;month=4&amp;year=2009&amp;hour=18&amp;min=9&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=136">see this time in your time zone</a>).</p>
<p>Her birth mass was 3.750 kilograms (8 pounds 4 ounces), and length was 50 centimetres (20 inches).</p>
<p>Now, a few people have asked me to blog more details about Isla’s birth, notably the events that led to her being born in an ambulance and not, as had been planned, at York District Hospital like her <a href="https://blog.iannelson.uk/benjamin-george-nelson/">big brother</a>. So, here goes. Inevitably, this is all from my perspective, though as Jocelyn’s side of things seemed to consist mostly of agonized screams and wailings, perhaps those aren’t the kind of details you want to hear anyway.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="call-1-it-begins">Call #1 – It Begins</h3>
<p>I was working in Leeds on Tuesday. The first inkling I got that something was about to happen was a phone call from Jocelyn at 14:10. She told me that she was experiencing pains of a largely indeterminate nature, but not to bother coming home from work at that stage, as it might be nothing. Fair enough. Apparently she had been out to aqua natal that morning, then run some errands, and had only just put Ben down for a nap and started to think about what the pains might be. The conversation lasted 2 minutes 6 seconds, and I went back to my work.</p>
<h3 id="call-2-come-home">Call #2 – Come Home</h3>
<p>The second phone call came at 14:50. It was just 17 seconds long:</p>
<p>“Hi Ian. So, these pains don’t seem to be going away.”</p>
<p>“You want me to come home?”</p>
<p>“Mmmmm, yeah – I think you’d better. Can you make the 3:15 train?”</p>
<p>“If I run. Speak to you soon.”</p>
<p>As I arrived at the station, I wondered whether I should pick up a copy of the day’s newspaper, for posterity in case the baby should be born that day. In all honesty I thought it a remote possibility, but bought a copy of <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk">The Times</a> anyway, reasoning that at least it would be something to read on the train home.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>As it happened, on the platform I bumped into Ruth, mother of one of Ben’s pals, so I had some company and conversation for the journey. That evening Ruth posted a comment on my Facebook page saying “Talk about cool, calm &amp; collected. You were more in control than me when I saw you this afternoon!!!”. This is true – Ruth had something of an “eeek!” expression on her face for most of the train ride. I, meanwhile, anticipated many hours of agonizing (and for me, boring) labour ahead before any real excitement (little did I know!), so I avoided Ruth’s panicked gaze by tweeting.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The train pulled into South Milford at around 15:45, and Jocelyn was there to pick me up (she’d waited for a contraction to pass before making the short journey to the station!)</p>
<h3 id="call-3-summoning-backup">Call #3 – Summoning Backup</h3>
<p>Before we could think about heading to the hospital, we needed someone to look after Benjamin. Fortunately my mum had been on standby for this task for several weeks, denying herself her usual daily allowance of wine in preparedness. I placed the call around 16:00:</p>
<p>“Mum, we need you please. Joce is in labour.”</p>
<p>“Oh. But I have a pot of chutney on the hob. Hmmm. How urgent is it?”</p>
<p>“Contractions about 10 minutes apart.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Well. I’m just going to have to leave the chutney, aren’t I?”</p>
<p>“Yep, I’m afraid so.”</p>
<p>Mums, don’tcha love their sense of priority? 😉</p>
<p>As we waited for backup to arrive, Jocelyn started pacing around the house in the way only a woman in labour possibly can. Benny thought this was hilarious, and walked behind his mother, playing “Follow the Leader”. I’m not entirely certain how much this helped Jocelyn’s situation – by this time most of the sounds emanating from her mouth were primeval groans. I just kept out of the way, and tweeted again.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<h3 id="call-4-we-re-coming-in">Call #4 – We’re Coming In</h3>
<p>When my mum arrived at ours around 17:00, I instinctively went to make her a cup of tea, and a drink for myself. It was at this point that the pacing, grunting, Jocelyn, stopped holding everything in and found her voice again.</p>
<p>“Call the hospital. Call the hospital. Need to go in,” she said, stabbing a forefinger at her green NHS notes. I did as I was told.</p>
<p>“Hello, my wife is in labour, and we’d like to come in, please,” I politely told the lady who answered the maternity ward phone.</p>
<p>“Well, you’re very direct and straight to the point!” she curtly replied. I hadn’t realised that I would be expected to make small talk. “Can I at least have some details?”</p>
<p>After providing the details requested (including “can I have a number beginning with ‘D’” – what kind of <em>number</em> begins with ‘D’ I wondered? Hexadecimal? I decided not to pursue that discussion at the present) she asked to speak to Jocelyn. I don’t know what they talked about – Joce just said “yes” three or four times, then put the phone down and told me we were to go to the hospital immediately. I was a tad disappointed that I wouldn’t be able to drink the cup of coffee that I’d just made myself, but thought it wise to keep this thought to myself, too.</p>
<h3 id="call-5-999">Call #5 – 999</h3>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.co.uk">Google maps</a> tells me that the 17.3 mile journey from our home to York District Hospital takes around 33 minutes. It’s strange, in my head I always think of it as being much shorter, I don’t know why. On this particular day, travelling at rush hour, it would have taken us even longer, due to heavy traffic and road works.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>By the time we were just a couple of miles from home, Jocelyn was screaming almost continually. Glancing at my watch as I drove, I timed the contractions to be three minutes apart, then reasoned with myself that I must have made a mistake and forgotten the original location of the minute hand – surely eight minutes would be more appropriate at this stage? But then the subsequent contraction came another three minutes hence, leaving lit<br>
tle doubt. I didn’t share these timings with Jocelyn, but I’m sure she was well aware of the immediacy of the situation.</p>
<p>My heart sank when we reached the A64 to find the eastbound carriageway moving at a snail’s pace. We trundled along for a mile or so, before Jocelyn spoke the truism that I’d not dared admit to myself:</p>
<p>“We’re not going to make it to the hospital. You’re going to have to call 999.”</p>
<p>Now, I’ve never had cause to phone 999 before. I had flashbacks to primary school assemblies wherein visiting police constables soberly explained the problems caused by hoax calls, and made it crystal clear that we should only <em>think</em> about dialling 999 if we were on the verge of death itself, lest we would surely go to hell, or at the very least be grounded for a good few weeks. These sessions obviously had a big influence on me, and I briefly hypothesised about an alternative solution to our problem, such as trying to force a route between the two lanes of near-stationary traffic. Jocelyn’s response came in the form of another anguished scream, and at 17:31 I placed the call. Mercifully my mobile had a charge, a signal, and Windows Mobile 6.1 hadn’t decided to crash when I wasn’t looking. Here’s how the conversation began:</p>
<p>“Emergency, which service please?”</p>
<p>“Ambulance.”</p>
<p>“Ambulance, can you tell me the number you’re calling from?”</p>
<p>“07901 828483”</p>
<p>“What’s the address to which you need an ambulance sent?”</p>
<p>“I’m travelling eastbound on the A64, east of Tadcaster. My wife is in labour, we’re trying to reach York hospital but we’re not going to get there in time.”</p>
<p>“OK. I need to figure out exactly where you are. Have you gone over the river?”</p>
<p>“Er, I’m not sure”. I wasn’t certain to which river she was referring (Ouse, Foss, Wharf?) and I couldn’t remember which was which anyway, so it seemed futile asking.</p>
<p>“Is there a lay-by or somewhere you can pull off the road and park?”</p>
<p>“Er… yes, we’re coming up to a small exit road now. Signed to Catterton and Healaugh.”</p>
<p>At this stage I was now glad that I’d made the call. The patient, calm lady on the other end of the phone told me to get off the A64, stop the car, put my hazards on, and await the assistance which was on the way. I used the “Where Am I?” TomTom functionality to confirm my location, and confirmed the colour and make of our vehicle. Then the operator told me I should “prepare and reassure my wife”. I think my efforts in respect of this task resulted in an epic fail.</p>
<h3 id="cavalry-cavalry">Cavalry {#cavalry}<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h3>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>After 9 minutes and 34 seconds the cavalry arrived, in the form of a down-to-earth Yorkshire chap in an ambulance responder vehicle. His initial words, on handing Jocelyn some nitrous oxide, were “There you go love, cop a load of that. Suck it in, there’s plenty!”. On being told that Jocelyn’s waters hadn’t broken, and nor was there any sign of a head, he frowned in my general direction, seemingly giving the impression that we were wasting his time, and I felt certain that he would dob me in to Mrs Lound, my primary school head teacher.</p>
<p>“Weren’t you listening during assembly, Ian?” I envisaged her asking me sternly, as she proceeded to instruct me, a grown man of 33, to stand on the naughty steps of a school building that had long since been demolished.</p>
<p>Then he glanced at his watch for a second time, and it seemed to dawn on him that, broken waters or not, contractions of only a minute apart indicate an imminent birth. He confirmed with the disembodied voices on his radio that an ambulance was on its way, before glancing up and down the length of our shiny Toyota Verso.</p>
<p>“What reg’ is this?” he asked me.</p>
<p>“Too new!” I shouted back, and he grinned back at me.</p>
<p>“We’d better get an ambulance then, hadn’t we?” he replied.</p>
<p>The ambulance duly arrived, and Jocelyn was transferred into it. I abandoned the Verso and joined her. The all-female crew, Jo and Jo, told us that the plan was to try to reach York Hospital. Being safety-conscious ladies, they instructed me to sit down and put a seatbelt on, leaving me unable to offer much support over and above shouted encouragements and gripping Jocelyn’s ankle supportively. Not for the first time that evening, I began to think that I probably wasn’t helping much.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>We’d only got a mile or so down the A64 before another blood-curdling cry and waters breaking all over the ambulance caused the crew to abandon all plans of reaching York Hospital in favour of delivering the baby at the side of the road, near to the services at Bilbrough top. From this point on, everything happened in double-quick time, and Isla Grace came into the world at 18:09.</p>
<p>We later learned that Isla was only the second baby that Jo and Jo had delivered in nine years of manning an ambulance. I wouldn’t have guessed; they seemed to know exactly what they were doing, and exuded an air of professionalism at all times. I was so thankful that we’d called the emergency services. Everyone grumbles occasionally about the enormous tax burden of the NHS, but there’s no denying that, in one’s hour of need, they really come through. God bless the Yorkshire Ambulance NHS Trust.</p>
<p>The high quality service continued as Isla and I transferred into a second ambulance whilst Jocelyn travelled ahead in the original vehicle. After checkups and a few stitches, Jocelyn was discharged from hospital later that evening. I took a £30 taxi ride to recover the Verso, we popped into a McDonald’s drive-thru for our supper, and we were all home and safely tucked up in bed by midnight.</p>
<p>It’s not an experience any of us want to relive, but as the bard said, All’s Well That Ends Well. And it’s a great story to tell Isla in a few years time.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

      <title>A British Wifey</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was a proud day indeed. Remember four years ago when I blogged about Jocelyn getting a fiancee visa from the British Consulate in Los Angeles, which paved the way for her to travel to Blighty with the intention of marrying me..?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Fiancee Visa!&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://blogstouks01.z33.web.core.windows.net/2023/08/fiancee-visa_18183343_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, since then we’ve turned that fiancee visa into a limited leave visa, and then into a settlement visa. We have spent over £2000 on government fees for these various rubber stamps – outrageously high amounts which resulted in letters being sent to and from the Home Office. Along the way, we got married, moved house, and of course &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/benjamin-george-nelson/&#34;&gt;Benjamin&lt;/a&gt; came along to change our lives forever (in a good way, of course, Son!).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>But I’m proud to report that today Jocelyn collected a certificate of naturalisation from Peter Sowray, Chairman of North Yorkshire County Council, granting her full British Citizenship.</p>

<p>She has already put this dual nationality to good use, by this evening registering to vote in both the UK and the US! Good on ya, wifey!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It gives me unparalleled joy to announce the birth of Mr Benjamin George Nelson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a relatively swift labour, the new arrival entered the world suddenly at York Hospital on Wednesday at 22:24 local time (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=25&amp;amp;month=7&amp;amp;year=2007&amp;amp;hour=22&amp;amp;min=24&amp;amp;sec=0&amp;amp;p1=136&#34;&gt;see this time in your time zone&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birth mass was 4.185 kilograms (9 pounds 3 ounces), length was 51 centimetres (20 inches).&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On this Remembrance Sunday, permit me to share with you a photo that my cousin Helen took this week of our Granduncle’s grave in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private William Henry Worfolk (1896 – 1916) of the York and Lancaster Regiment was my Grandfather’s elder brother (by four years), and was only just old enough to fight (and die) in the First World War. A couple of years later and it could just as easily have been my grandfather, and then I wouldn’t be here to tell you this tale. Ninety years on from that most bloody of wars, we still have much to be thankful for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
