      <title>London, I Apologise: An Unexpected Romance with the Capital</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For most of my adult life, in a way typical of those of us from the North, I have disdained London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too big. Too busy. Too smug. Too&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;London&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve long maintained that its gravitational pull distorts the rest of the country, and that one’s quality of life improves in direct proportion to one’s distance from Zone 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet — I am beginning to suspect that, deep down, behind my carefully-curated facade, I really rather like it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For most of my adult life, in a way typical of those of us from the North, I have disdained London.</p>
<p>Too big. Too busy. Too smug. Too&hellip; <em>London</em>. I’ve long maintained that its gravitational pull distorts the rest of the country, and that one’s quality of life improves in direct proportion to one’s distance from Zone 1.</p>
<p>And yet — I am beginning to suspect that, deep down, behind my carefully-curated facade, I really rather like it.</p>
<p>It started innocently enough: a team away day, one of those softly-mandated pilgrimages to headquarters. The sort of day filled with icebreakers (Lord help me),  and colleagues sketching their superhero alter-egos (naturally). But something about it all — the spring sunshine, the civility of strangers answering my dumb questions on the tube, the sheer <em>pleasantness</em> of the whole affair — began to crack my cynicism.</p>
<p>The train journey down there was full but tolerable. I even forgave the freeze-dried coffee sachet (£2.50, thanks LNER) and found unexpected delight in the rhythm of Audible piped through noise-cancelling headphones. I listened to Tony Blair musing on technocracy and health reform. The irony was not lost on me.</p>
<p>We gathered in a sleek office somewhere in Canary Wharf and talked about six-week software cycles and data integration. It should have been excruciating. But it wasn’t. It was&hellip; <em>fine</em>. I met a bright twenty-something who knew his stuff and didn’t make me feel ancient. I had a mini sushi box that I dearly wished had been a maxi. I bonded over high-level architecture diagrams and event-driven dreams.</p>
<p>Later, in the pub (where I eked out two £7.85 pints), I traded gossip and shots with colleagues I had previously only seen in pixelated form. At some point, without quite noticing, I found myself thinking: this is nice.</p>
<p>Two hours later, back on the train with a £7.49 Cornish pasty and aching legs, I declared it aloud: <em>I have decided to like London now.</em></p>
<p>It’s only two hours from Selby. The Elizabeth Line exists. The people — heaven help me — are making an effort. Even the pasty wasn’t terrible.</p>
<p>And so, London, I offer you this: a retraction. Not quite an apology I suppose, and certainly not a love letter. But a grudging acknowledgment that I’ve changed my mind. You’re alright. Let’s not get carried away.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Even a leopard can change its spots,” said Jocelyn when I told her. Quite right. And this particular leopard now travels with paracetamol in his rucksack, and periodically stretches in train aisles.</em></p></blockquote>

      <title>NDC Porto 2024</title>
      <link>https://blog.iannelson.uk/ndc-porto-2024/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of spending ISO Week 42 in the beautiful Portuguese coastal city of Porto, attending the NDC Porto 2024 conference for software developers by &lt;a href=&#34;https://ndcconferences.com/&#34;&gt;NDC Conferences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long time since I attended a multi-day conference – perhaps even as long ago as &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/software-architect-2007/&#34;&gt;Software Architect 2007&lt;/a&gt; (where I first learned about Dependency Injection and IOC Containers) which makes me feel quite ancient. Having been a freelancer since 2008, it’s often difficult to justify taking time out to attend conferences, no matter how valuable they might be to one’s career in the longer term. The face cost of the conference ticket is usually dwarfed by the loss of contract income (real or perceived) whilst being unable to bill a client.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>It’s been a long time since I attended a multi-day conference – perhaps even as long ago as <a href="https://blog.iannelson.uk/software-architect-2007/">Software Architect 2007</a> (where I first learned about Dependency Injection and IOC Containers) which makes me feel quite ancient. Having been a freelancer since 2008, it’s often difficult to justify taking time out to attend conferences, no matter how valuable they might be to one’s career in the longer term. The face cost of the conference ticket is usually dwarfed by the loss of contract income (real or perceived) whilst being unable to bill a client.</p>
<p>But circumstances conspired to make my attendance at NDC Porto possible this year. Firstly, I’m currently doing some exclusive and inside IR35 work for a client, which effectively results in me having some mandatory days off to play with for the first time in over 15 years. And secondly, I was lucky enough to win an all-access pass to any NDC Conference at a raffle held at the last <a href="https://www.dddnorth.co.uk">DDD North</a> event this March – so many thanks to the good folk at <a href="https://blackmarble.com">Black Marble</a> for organising that event, and to <a href="https://ndcconferences.com">NDC</a> for offering the prize.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogstouks01.z33.web.core.windows.net/2024/10/IMG_7645-1-1024x768.jpeg"></p>
<p>I had never been to Porto before, so took the opportunity to spend the weekend prior to the conference doing the tourist thing. The October weather was fantastic for walking around the historic city centre, taking in the cathedral, Torre dos Clérigos, and views of the Duoro river. My goodness, but it’s hilly though!</p>
<p>From my journal that Sunday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I realised that Porto doesn’t just appeal to my sense of sight. Of course the views are fantastic, but on a sunny Sunday like today there is also excellent music that carries far and wide from a range of talented buskers. Electric acoustic guitars and electric violins seemed to be the order of the day, with a mixture of classic and popular tunes. Porto also smells nice – people seem to have a variety of different fragrances that differ from those that I usually smell in Leeds. Of course there are great tastes in the form of the wines and seafood. And finally there are even things to touch – ceramic tiles, cork panels etc. Truly, this city is a feast for the senses.”</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="workshop--designing-microservices">Workshop – Designing Microservices</h2>
<p>Before the conference proper began on Wednesday, there were nine two-day workshops to choose from. I opted to attend <em>Designing Microservices</em> by <a href="https://samnewman.io">Sam Newman</a>. I had previously read Sam’s book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3UgfVME">Building Microservices</a></em>, and have been using microservices of some variety or other on projects since 2018. While these have sometimes been successful, I have often had the niggling doubt that some implementations on which I have worked could more accurately be described as being Distributed Monoliths, and I was eager to spend some focused time understanding when the lure of microservices should be resisted, and to dig into implementation patterns, along with examining related topics such as whether to use multirepo or monorepo approaches for source control.</p>
<p>As with Sam’s book, while ostensibly about microservices, the workshop also covered a wide range of more general architectural and software development topics that could be equally applied to traditional monoliths. It also struck a good balance between technical topics and organisational ones – how to structure teams for success when delivering a microservice-based solution. I appreciated this holistic coverage, as well as the tacit admission that microservice architectures may often not be the correct solution for a given project.</p>
<p>The workshop was delivered at a good pace, neither labouring points unnecessarily, nor glossing over more thorny topics that were worthy of due consideration. There was a good mixture of slides, dialogue, and some collaborative activity in small groups.</p>
<p>My only minor disappointment with the two-day workshop was a sense that a small minority of the other attendees were insufficiently engaged – returning late to the workshop room from our plentiful breaks, and checking their phones frequently. I assume they were attending at the behest of their employer rather than of their own volition, but this behaviour seemed disrespectful to Sam and the other attendees. I tried to ignore it.</p>
<h2 id="my-10-favourite-sessions">My 10 Favourite Sessions</h2>
<p>After the initial two days of workshops, the remaining three days were filled with over a hundred traditional one-hour sessions, with up to six sessions running concurrently. This led to sometimes difficult decisions about which sessions to attend. My strategy was generally to attend sessions covering higher-level broad-brush type topics, rather than those covering niche technologies which I could learn through reading online documentation. But even within these self-imposed guidelines, there was a wealth of material to choose from. I attended around twenty sessions – here are some thoughts on my favourite ten:</p>
<h3 id="keynote-tidy-first-a-daily-exercise-in-empirical-design-by-kent-beck">Keynote: Tidy First? A Daily Exercise in Empirical Design by Kent Beck</h3>
<p>The conference proper opened on Wednesday morning with a Keynote by Kent Beck, the creator of extreme programming, early proponent of Test-Driven Development, and one of the 17 original signatories to the Agile Manifesto. Like all the keynotes, this took place in the huge main expo hall of the conference. I can see the logistical logic behind this decision – notably that it is large enough to house all of the delegates, and ensures that the conference can kick off at 9am sharp, even if latecomers are still arriving. But on the downside there were no seats close to the stage area (I am 48 years old, the prospect of standing up for an hour didn’t appeal), whereas from the area with seats it was a struggle to hear Kent over the background chatter and espresso machines. I would learn from my mistakes and prop myself up on a table near the front for the following days’ keynotes.</p>
<p>My geriatric grumblings notwithstanding, from the portions I heard properly, this was a great talk, and I look forward to rewatching this on YouTube to fill in the gaps. Unlike every other session that I saw during the week, Kent did not have a traditional slide deck, but instead projected some freeform sketches to illustrate the concepts he discussed.</p>
<p>There was much talk about the perennial topics (and personal bugbears) of estimation, and the cost of software development, and how software designers can influence when money is spent and earned. The concept of optionality was introduced – if software can be changed, then the design does not matter. Features are easy to see, but options are difficult to see, yet this is why we invest in software. The cost of software is the cost of changing it, not the cost of building it. Some changes are surprisingly expensive, yet others are surprisingly cheap.</p>
<p>Some of my favourites quotes from the session (of which there were many, some of which would appear in the slides of other speakers later in the week):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Kent wrapped up with a few words on this year’s hot topic of AI. He drew parallels with the development of highly efficient steam engines during the Industrial Revolution, and explained how this had actually led to an increase in the use of coal (the Jevon’s Paradox). He offered that the AIs are not coming for our jobs any time soon and that we are, in fact entering a new golden age for programming. This topic would crop up again throughout the conference.</p>

<h3 id="being-staff-plus-by-ian-cooper">Being Staff Plus by Ian Cooper</h3>
<p>Having now notched up 27 years at the code face, I have recently been giving some considerations as to where to take my career in the coming years, without having to sell my soul to the devil and venture over to the dark side of management. This session from Ian Cooper on “Staff Plus” roles offered some great advice on the nature of senior technical leadership roles, and how to “move beyond code” while staying resolutely technical.</p>
<p>Ian offered a good balance of high-level strategic career advice married with a bunch of helpful tactical hints and tips for how to succeed (and demonstrate that success) in such roles, and I urge any other greybeards feeling frustrated with their careers to watch this presentation (<a href="https://youtu.be/l-oCDQGH3EU?si=nAIK3UqvDUhQPZpl">the version from NDC Oslo is online here</a>).</p>
<p>This was the first session that sent me scurrying to Amazon to buy some recommended books (it would not be the last!). By the time I got home to England on Saturday both <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3YtNpcY">T</a><a href="https://amzn.to/3NxVNlu">he Staff Engineer’s Path: A Guide for Individual Contributors Navigating Growth and Change</a></em> by Tanya Reilly and <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3NxWpHF">Staff Engineer: Leadership Beyond the Management Track</a></em> by Will Larson would be waiting for me.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogstouks01.z33.web.core.windows.net/2024/10/Image-20-10-2024-at-16.36-5-1024x768.jpeg"></p>
<h3 id="definition-of-insanity--timeouts-retries-and-idempotency-by-sam-newman">Definition Of Insanity – Timeouts, retries, and idempotency by Sam Newman</h3>
<p>This session by Sam Newman focused on some of key techniques for developing resilient distributed systems: Timing out remote calls that do not complete in a timely fashion, Retrying unsuccessful calls, and how to achieve idempotency to ensure that calls can be retried safely without undesirable side-effects.</p>
<p>This topic is highly relevant to a distributed system that I am developing for my current client, so I listened intently and appreciated the detailed low-level advice. I was particularly interested in the observation that <em>if a retry of an idempotent request succeeds, we should send back the same semantic response that we would have sent had the original request succeeded</em>. Also new to me was the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom Filter</a>.</p>
<p>Improving the resilience of distributed systems has been an interest of mine since reading the first edition of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3C3Qh7m">Release It!</a></em> by Michael Nygard in 2009. I’m delighted to see that Sam is currently authoring <a href="https://samnewman.io/books/building-resilient-distributed-systems/">a new book on this topic</a>, due for publication in 2025.</p>
<h3 id="open-source-open-mind-the-cost-of-free-software-by-dylan-beattie">Open Source, Open Mind: The Cost of Free Software by Dylan Beattie</h3>
<p>A light-hearted talk to end the first day of the conference, this session by Dylan Beattie was a whistle-stop tour of the history of open source software, covering notable successes, failures and lawsuits, followed by some thoughts on where “free software” goes from here.</p>
<p>A recording of <a href="https://youtu.be/vzYqxo13I1U?si=eacYByQwreIj2O_U">an earlier version of this talk from NDC Oslo 2024 is available online</a>, but Dylan had added extra material to the talk since then to cover the recent disputes between WordPress.com owners Automattic and WP Engine.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="keynote-can-you-trust-your-large-language-model-by-jodie-burchell">Keynote: Can you trust your (large language) model? by Jodie Burchell</h3>
<p>Thursday’s keynote by data scientist Jodie Burchell talked about how the quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has been measured, and highlighted structural deficiencies with both the benchmarks as well as the AI tooling themselves. I confess to not having devoted much time over the past year to understanding the “AI revolution”, so did not know what to expect from this talk, but I found it a fascinating and highly approachable explanation that has piqued my interest. My contemporary notes from this session read “Such a good talk. Chase down the slides, and sessions from <a href="https://youtu.be/lLNJld729bc?si=x2ASipnm2PGcKt6d">earlier</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/9EI_lqPUVEE?si=jR9HOaAHIPnc_qoD">NDCs</a>“.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogstouks01.z33.web.core.windows.net/2024/10/Image-20-10-2024-at-16.36-1024x768.jpeg"></p>
<h3 id="orchestration-vs-choreography-the-good-the-bad-and-the-trade-offs-by-laïla-bougriâ">Orchestration vs. Choreography: The good, the bad, and the trade-offs by Laïla Bougriâ</h3>
<p>Designing distributed systems regularly involves trying to decide between synchronous or asynchronous communication, and orchestration or choreography (and the combinations thereof). There are, of course, tradeoffs to make, but the design decisions are often made when considering only the happy path scenarios.</p>
<p>This excellent talk by Laïla Bougriâ took this complex nuanced subject, with all of its “it depends” messiness, and offered concrete guidance for when and how to implement each approach. One of my favourite sessions of the whole conference, and Laïla coped excellently with audio problems for the first third of the presentation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogstouks01.z33.web.core.windows.net/2024/10/Image-20-10-2024-at-16.27-2-1024x768.jpeg"></p>
<h3 id="a-developer-goes-to-the-movies-by-simon-painter">A Developer Goes to the Movies by Simon Painter</h3>
<p>Thursday, the middle day of the conference proper, was a long one, but fortunately there were some great light-hearted talks later in the day to balance those that required more intense thinking.</p>
<p>I had previously enjoyed seeing Simon Painter give his talk “From Ancient Greeks to Modern Geeks: Basic Machine Learning Algorithms” at DDD North in Hull in March 2024. For this new talk, he brings together his twin passions of movies and coding by presenting a visual history of computing and software developers as seen by Hollywood.</p>
<p>I don’t seem to have made as many notes on this talk, preferring to relax and enjoy the show (though sadly without popcorn), but I do recall enjoying the segments on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/">WarGames</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113957">The Net</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243">Hackers</a> (which I really must watch again soon). It was also intriguing to learn that the distinction for the first person to have portrayed a computer hacker in a movie goes to none other than Benny Hill!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogstouks01.z33.web.core.windows.net/2024/10/IMG_7647-1024x768.jpeg"></p>
<h3 id="how-simple-is-as-simple-as-possible-by-rendle">How Simple Is “As Simple As Possible”? by Rendle</h3>
<p>Rendle has been doing this programming lark for even longer than me. But unlike me (who merely grumbles about our industry through the medium of Instagram memes shared with equally bitter colleagues), Rendle is an ex-professional standup comic who takes the grumbling to a whole new level by holding up a (black) mirror to our industry in conference presentations such as this one.</p>
<p>The thing is, as the saying goes, <em>it’s funny because it’s true</em>. Rendle is on a mission to highlight how unnecessarily complex we have made most aspects of software design, development and deployment during his career, and proselytise for an easier, simpler and more productive life. Amen to that.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogstouks01.z33.web.core.windows.net/2024/10/IMG_7650-1024x768.jpeg"></p>
<h3 id="keynote-start-here-mindset-shifts-and-tools-for-building-career-confidence-in-a-post-pandemic-era-by-denise-jacobs">Keynote: Start Here: Mindset Shifts and Tools for Building Career Confidence in a Post-Pandemic Era by Denise Jacobs</h3>
<p>For Friday’s final keynote of the conference, I took my now-customary standing spot up front near the stage… and then immediately regretted it as I noticed the pens and paper dotted around the tables. I realised with horror that this was going to be an interactive session, and considered retreating to the back of the room. I do not generally enjoy audience participation, have no “fun facts” on hand to share about myself, and abhor “icebreakers” at the start of meetings and workshops.</p>
<p>But, I told myself that I had come all this way to Porto with the intention of adopting a growth mindset and learning as much as possible, so ought to give it a go. I’m glad I did, as Denise’s talk became one of my favourite of the conference, and the audience participation exercises (which were not as scary as I had feared) helped to boost my confidence and further renew my interest in my career.</p>
<p>I ordered yet another book recommendation on the back of this talk – <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3BNS3JM">Chatter: The Voice in Our Head and How to Harness It</a></em> by Ethan Kross, but opted for Audible this time to reduce the number of Amazon packages that would be arriving at home in my absence.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogstouks01.z33.web.core.windows.net/2024/10/Image-20-10-2024-at-16.25-4-1024x768.jpeg"></p>
<h3 id="the-next-decade-of-software-development-by-richard-campbell">The Next Decade of Software Development by Richard Campbell</h3>
<p>Richard Campbell is best known to me as the co-host of the <a href="https://www.dotnetrocks.com">.NET Rocks!</a> podcast, but his interest and expertise in science, computing, and technology is far broader than that niche (he gave another talk at this conference on the topic of Nuclear Power).</p>
<p>This talk on the Next Decade of Software Development has been presented many times over the years and been regularly updated as new trends such as the Cloud emerge and gradually become mainstream. It reviews where we’ve been, examines the trend lines, and looks forward to which trends and technologies we will need to learn to remain relevant in our roles in the upcoming years. As with many of the other talks, this naturally touched on AI, and joined that consensus that we are entering a period where the LLMs will aid our software development work rather than directly threatening it. At a more prosaic level, Richard was also positive that .NET and Blazor are not going anywhere any time soon.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed my time at NDC Porto. The conference is expertly organised by a team who have clearly been doing this for quite some time. The venue – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Convention_Centre">a former customshouse on the banks of the Duoro</a> – was airy and inspirational. The complementary food and drink was delicious and plentiful. The speakers were knowledgeable and friendly, making themselves available for questions outside of the sessions themselves. Generally I found my fellow attendees to be amiable and approachable, and appreciated mingling amongst the wide variety of nationalities present from across the European continent and further afield. I remain disheartened by the male skew in the gender balance of attendees at tech conferences, but it was pleasing to note how many (excellent) female speakers gave talks – I suspect and hope that NDC are doing all they reasonably can to improve diversity.</p>
<p>I return home to Yorkshire, and back to the code face, with a renewed enthusiasm for my chosen career and a rekindled excitement for technologies (both new and old – some of the talks by Anders Norås have made me nostalgic for my Amiga 500 and 1200!). Oh, and with an ever-growing pile of books to read!</p>

      <title>Scotland With A Son – Into The Highlands With My 10 Year Old</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-one-saturday-26th-may-2018&#34;&gt;Day One – Saturday 26th May 2018&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty years after bagging my first Munro – the dreary &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.iannelson.uk/meall-a-chrasgaidh/&#34;&gt;Meall a’ Chrasgaidh&lt;/a&gt; – and somehow developing an affinity for the Great Scottish Outdoors, I found myself heading northwards once again. Not this time in the company of my university friends, but instead with a ten-year-old boy in tow, namely my eldest Son, Benjamin. It was half-term holiday, he had just finished SATs, and I was hoping to prise him away from screens for a few days and to pass on some of my latent enthusiasm for the Highlands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="day-one-saturday-26th-may-2018">Day One – Saturday 26th May 2018</h3>
<p>Twenty years after bagging my first Munro – the dreary <a href="https://blog.iannelson.uk/meall-a-chrasgaidh/">Meall a’ Chrasgaidh</a> – and somehow developing an affinity for the Great Scottish Outdoors, I found myself heading northwards once again. Not this time in the company of my university friends, but instead with a ten-year-old boy in tow, namely my eldest Son, Benjamin. It was half-term holiday, he had just finished SATs, and I was hoping to prise him away from screens for a few days and to pass on some of my latent enthusiasm for the Highlands.</p>
<p>The journey took longer than I expected. We departed home around 1030 and reached Killin by 1700. Google helped us avoid two traffic jams, a technology that hadn’t existed on my earliest Scottish trips in 1998 (nor, for that matter, did the A74(M)’s parenthetical M). We were staying at the <a href="http://www.bridgeoflochay.co.uk/">Bridge of Lochay Hotel</a>, and after a pleasant evening meal there we took a drive down the road between <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/perthshire/ben-lawers.shtml">Ben Lawers</a> and the Bridge of Balgie, where we saw a bewildering number of wild campers.</p>
<p>Back at the hotel, we got Scrabble out. Showing no mercy against my opponent’s tender years, I played all seven tiles on one round to spell ALBUMEN and turn EATING into BEATING, scoring 75 points.

<h3 id="day-two-sunday-27th-may-2018">Day Two – Sunday, 27th May 2018</h3>
<p>I was cognisant that if I was to make the trip a success and a happy memory for Ben (and thus encourage him to want to return), there was no point dragging him up some featureless 3,000-footers. Instead I had planned a whistle-stop tour of the Highlands’ best views, with some fun touristy activities thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>The first of these activities was a trip to <a href="https://goape.co.uk/locations/aberfoyle">Go Ape</a> at Aberfoyle, which culminated with a stunning 45-metre-high, 426-metre-long zipwire flight followed by a bottle of Irn Bru.</p>
<p>Refreshed, we headed up the nearby <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/lochlomond/ben-aan.shtml">Ben A’an</a>, at 454m one of the most popular and picturesque wee hills in Scotland. The weather was unseasonably fine, and we were offered glorious views across the Trossachs.</p>
<p>We left Ben A’an car park around 1700. Ben dozed off in the car, and we reached our accommodation at the legendary <a href="https://clachaig.com/">Clachaig Inn</a> by 1840. By this late hour and following our earlier exertions Ben was super tired and hangry – reluctant to eat but perked up noticeably after having done so. I realised that a quieter day was probably in order for the following day.

<h3 id="day-three-monday-28th-may-2018">Day Three – Monday, 28th May 2018</h3>
<p>A quieter day than Sunday. Initially Ben was adamant that he wanted to do more walk<br>
ing (Ben A’an having whet his appetite for views), so we intended to wander up the <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/fortwilliam/lostvalley.shtml">Lost Valley of Glencoe</a>. But upon reaching the car park, he declared that he did not feel well enough for a hike – something that has happened to me on more than one occasion! So instead we went up the nearby <a href="https://www.nevisrange.co.uk/activities/mountain-gondola/">Nevis Range Mountain Gondola</a> on the north face of <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/munros/aonach-mor">Aonach Mor</a>. The sun was beaming down again, a far cry from the whiteout conditions that I had experienced on 25th November 2000 when my friends and I had to abandon an attempt to reach the Aonach Mor summit from nearby Aonach Beag.</p>
<p>Back down to the car, and with Ben still not in the mood for activity, we took a long drive around Ardnamurchan – Glenuig, Strontian (location of the discovery of Strontium, as I boringly explained to Ben in typical Dad fashion), and back via the Corran Ferry. I resisted the small temptation to take a short but lengthy detour down the narrow tracks to <a href="https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/kilchoan/ardnamurchanpoint/index.html">Ardnamurchan Point</a>, having fallen into that trap on a previous jaunt at August Bank Holiday 2002. Despite this, the relative lack of civilisation for miles around was not lost on us as we struggled to find a convenient place to stop for a bite of lunch. I vowed to learn this lesson on subsequent days, stocking up the car with sandwiches and snacks at the start of the day rather than risk a hungry and grumpy pre-teen companion.</p>
<p>In the evening we sat outside the Clachaig playing chess. We heard tell of a couple of other tourists who had required medical attention after being up on a ridge with too little water and no sunhats. After this it was easier on subsequent days to persuade Ben to wear his own sunhat.

<h3 id="day-four-tuesday-29th-may-2018">Day Four – Tuesday, 29th May 2018</h3>
<p>A lot of driving, unfortunately. I had forgotten how long it can take to get from A to B in the Highlands sometimes. After stopping in Fort William for sandwiches and a pack of playing cards we headed for the picture postcard <a href="https://www.eileandonancastle.com/">Eilean Donan Castle</a>. Here the increasing popularity (and potential Disneyfication) of the Highlands began to hit me. I have photographs from 2002 wherein my friends and I were the only visitors to an otherwise deserted EDC. No longer – extended car and coach parks and additional visitor infrastructure were now in place to accommodate the hoards of tourists.</p>
<p>We enjoyed an ice cream each in the stifling heat before driving up to Plockton, passing the alarming sight of a wildfire in its early stages en route. We later learned that an electrical transformer had exploded, igniting part of the tinder-dry Strathellen Wood. After a quick drink in <a href="https://plocktonhotel.co.uk/">The Plockton Hotel</a> we boarded the legendary <a href="https://calums-sealtrips.com/">Calum’s Seal Trip</a>, without which no trip to the north west would be complete. Apart from ourselves, the boat was filled with Italian tourists, who laughed politely at Calum’s gags, which have not changed at all in the last twenty years. One of the staff explained to me that Scotland has become more popular than ever with foreign visitors in recent years, and attempted to convince those same foreign guests that the inexplicably brilliant 2018 weather was typical for the location and time of year.</p>
<p>We stayed at a very pleasant and peaceful <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/6501251">AirBnB by the name of Fasgro in Drumbuie</a>. Our host, Carol, recommended an evening coastal walk, which turned out to be one of my highlights of the entire trip.

<h3 id="day-five-wednesday-30th-may-2018">Day Five – Wednesday, 30th May 2018</h3>
<p>We left Drumbuie, passed through Lochcarron, and headed up the Bealach na Ba pass, which was a much easier drive in the summer months than winter snows. For one thing there were no angry van drivers to wind their windows down as we passed and inexplicably yell at me for being a “bloody fool”. Scottish hospitality has definitely improved.</p>
<p>After parking up, we took advantage of our high altitude to wander up to the transmitter station, then over to the 792m Corbett <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/torridon/Sgurrachaorachain.shtml">Sgurr a’ Chaorachain</a>. I thought this was an easy walk with cracking views over to Skye and Raasay. But Ben was hard work, complaining every step of the way and having to be bribed to continue (I placed Amazon orders for new XBox games from the Corbett summit!). I was unsure why he disliked this walk compared to the steeper exertions of Ben A’an earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Back to the car, and we drove through the majestic <a href="https://www.nts.org.uk/visit/places/torridon">Torridon</a>, Kinlochewe (stopped for another ice cream), and on to the <a href="http://www.aultguish.co.uk/">Aultguish Inn</a>. There has clearly been some capital investment here, as the room facilities had improved immeasurably since my visits in the earliest years of the century.

<h3 id="day-six-thursday-31st-may-2018">Day Six – Thursday, 31st May 2018</h3>
<p>Ben was sick in the night, explaining his lack of enthusiasm on the hills the previous day. We abandoned plans to scramble up <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/ullapool/stacpollaidh.shtml">Stac Pollaidh</a>, and instead opted for more driving – a big circular route around the far north. We saw Durness, Tongue, and some wonderful coastal scenes along the A836 across the very top of the country, before reaching the anticlimactic John O’Groats where we bought some soft toys and sweets as gifts for Ben’s siblings. Our journey back down the eastern seaboard was shrouded in thick fog, depriving us of any seascape views.</p>
<p>In the evening we played card games in the hotel bar, by which time Ben was on much better form, thrashing my exhausted self at most games and feeling well enough to devour the biggest dessert on the menu.</p>
<p>After Ben retired to our room to watch some TV talent show, I got chatting to a pleasant young bohemian lady, who had recently embarked on an attempted continuous round of the Munros, travelling between them on bicycle. I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t slightly envious of her freedom and ability to take so much time out of the rat race for such an endeavour. But conversely, I was happy to have had a Son in tow with whom to share a brief week experiencing some of the many delights that Scotland has to offer to all ages.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I keep intending, and forgetting to post a couple of videos from our US holiday last April. I suppose I was hoping to get round to writing up my paper notes from the holiday, but it’s becoming apparent that won’t happen anytime soon, so let’s skip forward to the funny bits:</p>
<p>We spent a couple of nights at the Stratosphere Hotel in Las Vegas, which is the tallest observation tower in the United States. Atop the tower are three “thrill rides”, and I foolishly tried all of them whilst Jocelyn videoed proceedings from a safe distance.</p>
<p>The Big Shot, at 329m high is the highest ride in the world. This is essentially a big pole with seats around the side that flings you straight up, quickly, and drops you down again. You’ve probably seen these elsewhere, this is much the same except it happens to be on the top of a very tall building and hence offers mighty fine views over the Las Vegas desert. We don’t have any video of this as it all happened a bit too quickly for Joce to catch.</p>
<p>X-Scream, at 264m high is the third highest ride in the world. This is basically a glorified bench that dangles off the edge of the building, and it is one of the scariest things I’ve ever experienced!  From inside the building Jocelyn captured the video below – turn up the volume to hear some Aussie tourists laughing at my predicament!</p>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ANTRHMjBRbU?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </div>

<p>Insanity, at 274m high is the second highest ride in the world. According to Wikipedia, “it dangles riders over the edge of the tower and then spins in a circular pattern at approximately forty miles per hour”. This was also pretty scary, though the constant circular motion made it less terrifying than the X-Scream (with its stop-start “aha, you thought you were going to continue falling for another 100+ storeys” shenanigans). Here’s a video of me on the Insanity – can’t think why I’m the only partipant…</p>

      <title>USA Trip 2006: Breakfast Prep</title>
      <link>https://blog.iannelson.uk/usa-trip-2006-breakfast-prep/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2006 15:05:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://blog.iannelson.uk/usa-trip-2006-breakfast-prep/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On our first morning in California, we headed out to breakfast, which was preceded by a short session of Breakfast Prep’, courtesy of Jocelyn.  It had been a couple of years since I’d last had Breakfast In America, and I’d forgotten how to respond to the awesome number of choices and options that would be flung in my direction by the waitperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how you order breakfast in Britain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diner: &amp;ldquo;Full English Breakfast, please.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Waitress: &amp;ldquo;D&amp;rsquo;you want tea or coffee with that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Diner: “Tea, please.”&lt;br&gt;
Waitress: &amp;ldquo;OK.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On our first morning in California, we headed out to breakfast, which was preceded by a short session of Breakfast Prep’, courtesy of Jocelyn.  It had been a couple of years since I’d last had Breakfast In America, and I’d forgotten how to respond to the awesome number of choices and options that would be flung in my direction by the waitperson.</p>
<p>Here’s how you order breakfast in Britain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Diner: &ldquo;Full English Breakfast, please.&rdquo;<br>
Waitress: &ldquo;D&rsquo;you want tea or coffee with that?&rdquo;<br>
Diner: “Tea, please.”<br>
Waitress: &ldquo;OK.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>In due course, the standard, empire-forging breakfast is served, and is consumed heartily, perhaps after a little trading with your breakfasting companions (“I’ll swap you my tomatoes for a rasher of your bacon?”).  Everybody knows what is expected, nobody has tricky decisions to make, there are no surprises, and everyone enjoys what they get – and if they don’t enjoy it, well, they don’t mention it, because complaining about such things just wouldn’t be British, damn it.</p>
<p>Now, compare that if you will to the American breakfasting experience.  The sheer size of the American breakfast menu is symptomatic of the culture of Choice that seems to pervade all aspects of the consumer experience here (especially in California), and it really can take some time to pick an option.  But making your selection is only the beginning.  Here’s how a sample breakfast order conversation with an unexpecting Brit (i.e. me, two years ago), might go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Waitperson: “Are you ready to order?”<br>
Me: “I think so.  I’ll have the Sausage and Eggs, please.”<br>
Waitperson: “Do you want links sausages or patty?&quot;<br>
Me: “Oh.  Um, links, please.”<br>
Waitperson: “How do you want your eggs?<br>
Me: “Fried, please.”<br>
Waitperson: &ldquo;Fried how?&rdquo;<br>
Me: “Fried how?  In a frying pan, preferably!”<br>
Waitperson: “Over hard, over easy, over medium, or sunny side up?”<br>
Me: “What the…?”<br>
Jocelyn: “You have them sunny side up, honey.”<br>
Me: “Oh, OK.  Sunny side up then, please.”<br>
Waitperson: “And what two sides would you like?”<br>
Me: “I beg your pardon?”<br>
Waitperson: “You get a choice of two side options from the list there…”</p></blockquote>
<p>I consult the list, by this time panicking a tad, and wondering what exactly “Campfire potatoes” (one of the options) are…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: “OK, I’ll go for hash browns and bacon, please.”<br>
Waitperson: “And what would you like to drink with that?”<br>
Me: &ldquo;Coffee, please.&rdquo;<br>
Waitperson: “Latte, Americano, Cappuccino, Espresso…?  Decaf or Regular…?”<br>
Me: “Oh God, er, regular cappuccino, please.”<br>
Waitperson: “And what bread would you like for your toast?”<br>
Me: “Brown, please.”<br>
Waitperson: “Brown?!”<br>
Jocelyn: &ldquo;He means wheat.&rdquo;<br>
Waitperson: &ldquo;OK, coming up&hellip;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>At which point I breathed a sigh of relief and started to dab at my heavily perspiring brow.  Who ever knew that ordering breakfast could be such a complicated experience?  The food is invariably delicious and the portions are big enough to feed a family of four for a week – after a decent US-style breakfast I rarely feel the need for a big lunch or dinner.  I can see how these levels of choice might be appealing if you’ve grown up with them and come to expect such options, but for the uninitiated it’s just baffling, confusing, and seems unnecessary.  Which is why, two years later, I won’t venture into a breakfast restaurant until I’ve done a bit of preparation into my responses to the likely questions.</p>
<p>Even the simplest snippets of dialogue can provoke unexpected reactions.  Back to that restaurant conversation from two years ago, when we’d finished eating, and I’d relaxed my guard a bit, the waitperson came to clear up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Waitperson: “So, how were your eggs?&quot;<br>
Me: &ldquo;They were lovely, thank you.&rdquo;<br>
Waitperson: &ldquo;<em>Lovely</em>? Ha ha! Where the hell are you from?!&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Utterly bemusing!</p>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;monday-10th-april-2006&#34;&gt;Monday 10th April 2006&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun was still shining as we touched down at SFO, about 22 hours after we’d woken up.If every day could last that long, I swear I’d get more work done – or maybe I’d just spend more time playing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.civ4.com&#34;&gt;Civilization&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We picked up the car – a Pontiac Impala which initially seemed unfeasibly huge compared to our Focus, but it’s funny how quickly you adjust and get used to the size, making use of the available space – then it was off down US 101 on the final leg of our journey.Despite it being rush hour, we had a swift journey due to being able to use the Car Pool lane (by virtue of not being a single-occupant vehicle).I was amazed how under-utilised this lane was, and started wondering how much of an incentive would be needed for more Bay area commuters to start sharing rides – there’s another good question for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freakonomics.com&#34;&gt;the economists&lt;/a&gt; to ponder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>The sun was still shining as we touched down at SFO, about 22 hours after we’d woken up.If every day could last that long, I swear I’d get more work done – or maybe I’d just spend more time playing <a href="http://www.civ4.com">Civilization</a>…</p>
<p>We picked up the car – a Pontiac Impala which initially seemed unfeasibly huge compared to our Focus, but it’s funny how quickly you adjust and get used to the size, making use of the available space – then it was off down US 101 on the final leg of our journey.Despite it being rush hour, we had a swift journey due to being able to use the Car Pool lane (by virtue of not being a single-occupant vehicle).I was amazed how under-utilised this lane was, and started wondering how much of an incentive would be needed for more Bay area commuters to start sharing rides – there’s another good question for <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com">the economists</a> to ponder.</p>
<p>Joce drove – I didn’t think it prudent for my first transatlantic driving experience to come during rush hour at the end of a long day’s travelling – and I gazed out of the window, musing again at the open, opportune feeling of the region, despite its large population.There are new buildings springing up, visible signs of affluence, and it all combines to create the feeling (illusion?) that anything is possible, there’s no history to hold back your dreams.And of course, as a professional software developer, I was very aware of the kind of businesses to be found in cities such as Mountain View, Sunnyvale, and Palo Alto, that we sped through.</p>
<p>Back home, there’s something about York – the wealth of history, the cramped streets maybe – that convinces me that it’s nigh-on impossible to get noticed or make an impact in such a city.How can you make your mark in a city with so many Roman remains on every street corner?  There’s always a nagging feeling that someone got there first, that it’s all been done before.Name some famous people who’ve made an impact in York?  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivar_the_Boneless">Ivar the Boneless</a>?  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sentamu">John Sentamu</a>?  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judi_Dench">Dame Judi Dench</a>?  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Witter">Rick Witter</a>?  I hypothesised that this might partly explain the large number of Guilds, Companies, Lodges, Fraternities and Clubs in the city – people band together in an effort to attain power and influence.Is there a Company of Merchant Adventurers in North California?  I suspect not.</p>
<p>I shared my musings with Jocelyn.She said &ldquo;Well&hellip; what sort of an impact would you like to make?&rdquo;  I confessed that I didn’t have the foggiest idea.She rightly suggested that maybe it would be a good idea to decide that first, and worry about geography later.</p>

<p>Travelling West during the daytime is a blast, especially on a sunny day.Time it right and you can experience daylight for 24 hours, which afforded me time to catch up on some reading.For Christmas Joce had given a book entitled <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/">Freakonomics – A Rogue Economist Explores The Hidden Side Of Eveything</a>, and now I finally had time to read through it.I surprised myself by finishing it by the time we reached Chicago – this may be a chunky hardback book on economics, but it’s also <em>really</em> interesting and easy-going.</p>
<p>The book answers a mixed bag of questions – Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? – by using standard economic tools.The results are fascinating – go check out some <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/chapter.php">chapter excerpts</a> on the website if you don’t believe me.</p>
<p>Anyway, that book, combined with Barney, my trusty iPod made the flights, well, fly by.It was the first time I’ve travelled whilst carrying almost my entire music collection in my pocket, and having that level of choice really pleased me.Previously, no matter how many tapes or CDs I carried, there would always be something left at home that I had a desperate urge to listen to, and I never seemed to have the music to match my mood – which is <a href="http://www.intp.org/intprofile.html">essential for an INTP</a>.</p>
<p>At O’Hare airport, we discovered a small advantage of our transatlantic marriage – we can choose to go through passport control together through either the &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; or &ldquo;foreigners&rdquo; queue (natually, we picked the shorter one), in order to provide a complete picture to the immigration officer.The time savings we gained here were, however, subsequently lost when we inadvertantly picked up the wrong suitcase at baggage reclaim – I ask you, what are the chances of somebody else having the exact same model of case, <em>and</em> tying a blue ribbon around the handle to make it more easily identifiable?  Less minimal than we expected, evidently.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month Jocelyn and I took a trip to the States to visit friends and family, attend Teri &amp;amp; Jimmy’s wedding, and take a vacation to Nevada and Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there we were, sitting at the departure gate at Manchester Airport on a bright Monday morning, having awoken at 04:30 to make our way across the Pennines.A few seats away were a group of teenagers.They were from Michigan, and they were annoyingly noisy.Thus began our American adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>So, there we were, sitting at the departure gate at Manchester Airport on a bright Monday morning, having awoken at 04:30 to make our way across the Pennines.A few seats away were a group of teenagers.They were from Michigan, and they were annoyingly noisy.Thus began our American adventure.</p>
<p>Joce was the first to show irritation at her countrymen – &ldquo;God, why is it that only the fat obnoxious noisy American choose to travel abroad?&quot;.In retrospect, I’m not sure that’s true – it’s just that, by their nature, you’re more likely to notice obnoxious noisy people, of any nationality, and the non-native accents just make them stand out even more.As it happened, there were some British teens mixed into the group – some kind of exchange trip between West Yorkshire and Michigan, no doubt providing some well-earned relief for the parents.</p>
<p>Ignoring this noise, we focused our attentions instead on the cute little lass (circa 2 or 3 years?) wandering round with wide eyes, and playing with her dad.
&ldquo;We’ll have kids like that,&rdquo; Joce told me.</p>
<p>Yikes!</p>

      <title>Aussie Apostle Claimed By Sea</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Twelve Apostles, before Sunday&amp;rsquo;s collapse&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://blogstouks01.z33.web.core.windows.net/2023/08/twelve-apostles_13454971_o.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy cow, one of the limestone towers at Australia’s Twelve Apostles park has collapsed into the sea!  It was the one in the foreground of the photo to the left. Seeing this fantastic set of rock formations (and flying over them in a helicopter) was one of the many highlights of my vacation to Australia in Dec 2002 / Jan 2003. You always hear about coastal erosion and the way landscape changes over time, but never really expect significant changes to occur during your own lifetime&lt;/p&gt;</description>
