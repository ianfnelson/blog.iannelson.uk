That line of code you’re absent-mindedly knocking out today will probably be read dozens of times by your colleagues and future developers. It behoves you to make your intentions as clear as possible at every opportunity. Ambiguity in code is a truly terrible thing.

We should take the time to implement the correct solution, whether that be as simple as a separate method with a more specific name, or a polymorphic family of suitably-named classes that implement the same interface. This kind of boolean parameter, quick as it is to add, not only slows us down but is often symptomatic of a deeper flaw in the class design.\nDon’t even get me started on the optional parameters introduced in C# 4.0. It’s all too easy to invoke methods without noticing the existence of optional parameters with surprising defaults which can cause unexpected consequences. A sprinkling of syntactic sugar that can act as a catalyst for code decay.\n“Flag arguments are ugly. Passing a boolean into a function is a truly terrible practice. It immediately complicates the signature of the method, loudly proclaiming that this function does more than one thing. It does one thing if the flag is true and another if the flag is false!”\n— Robert C. Martin, Clean Code\nAs with many design principles, the visibility of the method is key in how problematic this code smell becomes. A boolean parameter on a private method, while a potential candidate for refactoring at a suitable time, is not the end of the world. But a boolean parameter on a public method, perhaps a member on a public interface, is a more pressing problem. Think very carefully before adding a boolean parameter to a method on a public API or other service boundary.\nAntipattern 2 – Methods that (unnecessarily) return booleans OK, so I’ve explained that I don’t much like methods that take boolean parameters. What about methods that return them?\nWell, I am an advocate of Command-Query Separation. Generally, if a method returns a bool I’m going to assume that it’s free of side effects and is answering a query, like this:\nConversely, when methods actually do stuff (i.e. commands), I wouldn’t expect them to return anything at all, least of all a boolean.\nOK, a couple of notable exceptions to this rule.
