With its help and guidance I came to love and respect Microsoft’s premier database product, passing the 70-229 exam by a comfortable margin.\nSo, following the release of SQL Server 2005, I was hoping that SAMS would publish a similar tome about that new platform.

In fact, it’s so large that eight chapters have been left out of the physical book, and are included only in a PDF version supplied on CD-ROM. These aren’t just padding or filler, either – they’re solid chapters on interesting topics as Notification Services, Service Broker, Recovery Planning, and T-SQL Tips n Tricks.

While perhaps not being suitable for beginners, for those with some experience of SQL Server or other relational database products, this book works on many levels – reference, tutorial, guidance, or just as an interesting read. If you work with, or anticipate working with, SQL 2005, then you owe it to yourself to get a copy now!\nI hate this term, but that’s what Amazon call it – “pre-order”.
