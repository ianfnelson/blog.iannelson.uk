Ben: “Ian, Ian!”
Me: “Ben, I’m ‘Daddy’ to you.”
Ben (quizzically): “But you are ‘Ian’ as well.”
Me: “Yes, I know that, but I’d prefer it if you called me ‘Daddy’.”
Ben: “Oh. Sorry, Ian!”
August 2010

Ben: “Can I have another bedtime story Dad?”
Me: “Not tonight Ben, it’s too late and you’re too tired.”

Daddy, I can hear your brains!”\nIan: “Say that again?”\nBen: “I can hear your brains!”\nIan: “You can hear my *brains*? How?”\nBen: “Through the holes on your head!”\nJocelyn: “So, what does Daddy’s brain sound like?”\nBen: “It’s *really* loud!”\nIan: “You got that right. Eat your pasta.”\nAugust 2010\nBen: “I’ve done a poo! It is a polar-bear-shaped poo!”\nAugust 2010\nMe: “I love you, Ben. I always wanted a son, I’m glad you came along.”\nBen: “Yes, Dad. I was just walking along the road, wasn’t I? I saw you and thought ‘He can be my Daddy’. And I came in the house and took my shoes off.”\nNovember 2010\nBenjamin just woke up after having had a bad dream “about the evil penguin on Pingu”. I must have missed that bit…\nDecember 2010\nAt Newmillerdam country park:\nBen: “AAAaaargh! It’s a crocodile!!!! Oh, no… it’s just a duck.”\nApril 2011\nAt 7pm at the end of a long Bank Holiday Saturday:\nBen: “Am I going to Play School today?”\nApril 2011\nOn taking a break from reading a book:\nBen: “I’m just going to pause my book.”\nMay 2011\nBen: “My brain can’t let me sleep!”\nJune 2011\nOn being told that we’re going on holiday to The Netherlands:\nBen: “Where Peter Pan comes from?!”\nJune 2011\nOn overhearing us discussing the closure of the News of the World:\nBen: “Daddy, did you just say the world is closing?!”\nPoor boy thought it was the apocalypse.\nJuly 2011\nNovember 2013\nBen: “I can’t sleep! I’ve got thirty-nine bits of energy!”\nJuly 2011\nOn Christmas Eve:\nBen: “How many more sleeps is it until my birthday?”\nDecember 2011\nIn the bath:\nBen: “I’ve got a BOMB! With flipper-hitters!!”\nMe: “Ben, that’s a duck.”\nAre all four-year-old boys like this?\nFebruary 2011\nMe: “Ben, please stop replying to everything I say with ‘Yeah, but…’.”\nBen: “Well, what can I say instead?”\nMe: “How about ‘OK Dad’?”\nBen: “OK Dad but…”\nMarch 2011\nBen: “DAD! Can I have some cheese?”\nMe: “OK.”\nBen: “And when you’re done getting my cheese, can you put a show on TV for me, ‘cos there are commercials on.”\nMe: “Oh OK, we can’t have you watching commercials, we know how susceptible you are! What are the commercials talking about?”\nBen: “Cheese.”\nMarch 2011\nMe: “Have you got Daddy a present for Christmas?”\nIsla: “Yes. A newspaper. You say ‘Oh boy!’”\nDecember 2011\nIsla: “What are you doing, Mummy?”\nJoce: “Just holding Daddy’s hand.”\nIsla: “So that he doesn’t run away?”\nJanuary 2012\nI spent a good ten minutes this evening reading Isla a Ladybird book about Vikings. Their culture, food, tools where they came from, etc. The last page posed the question “What would you do if you were a Viking?”\nIsla considered this briefly, then suggested “Play ‘Angry Birds’?”\nFebruary 2012\nIsla: “Where has the sunshine gone, Daddy?”\nApril 2012\nIsla: “Shall I shriek at you?”\nMay 2012\nIsla’s latest suggested name for her younger brother: “Yehudi Poo Tentacle”. Might veto that one…\nJune 2012\nBen: “Hey Dad, in about three more birthdays you’ll be nearly 40”\nMe: “That’s right Ben. It’s a bit scary really.”\nBen: “Yeah, and I know why you’re\nscared. ‘Cos you’ll be closer to dying.”\n😐\nJune 2012\nMe: “Hi Isla! What is Mr Tumble up to today?” (she was watching TV)\nIsla: “Pooing on your head.”\nMe: “O-K… any ideas where you would like me to take you today?”\nIsla: “Pooland.”\nAh, the scatalogical leanings of a three-year-old. It could be a long day.\nJune 2012\nOn buying a second car:\nBen: “There’s no stopping us now!”\nSeptember 2012\nMe: “So tell me about your new swimming instructor. Is it a lady or a man?”\nBen: “Well, for the undeep bit it’s a…”\nMe: “The what? The undie bit?”\nBen: “The UNDEEP bit of the pool.”\nMe: “Oh, I see – we call that the ‘shallow’ end.”\nBen: “OK. For the shallow bit of the pool it’s a lady. For the unshallow bit it’s a man.”\nSeptember 2012\nIsla: “I am not calling my brother Matthew Hengry. I am just calling him Matthew.”\nMe: “Good, ‘cos his middle name is ‘Henry’”\nIsla: “Hengry”.\nMe: “Henry.”\nIsla: “Hengry”.\nMe: “HEN-“\nIsla: “Hen”\nMe: “-RY”\nIsla: “-ry”\nMe: “Henry”\nIsla: “Hengry”.\nSeptember 2012\nOn being told to get out of bed on an early-Autumn morning:\nIsla: “But it is still dark!”\nBen: “Can we have breakfast in bed?”\nOctober 2012\nIsla: “Daddy, what are manners?”\nMe: “Manners tell us how to behave nicely, to say ‘please’ and ‘thank you’, how to eat our meals politely, that kind of thing.”\nIsla: “Are you and mummy my manners?”\nOctober 2012\nNannan: “That was good reading Ben – what shall I put in your reading record book?”\nBen: “Put ‘Ben is magnificent and should be moved up a level’”.\nOctober 2012\nEven at bedtime, and even when utterly misheard – if one child asks for something, their sibling demands it too. Case in point:\nBen: “Dad, can I have a kiss and cuddle?”\nIsla: “I WANT A MISTER MUDDLE!”\nOctober 2012\nI told the kids they could only have one bedtime story each as it was late.\nBen chose The Odyssey.\nOctober 2012\nMe: “Ben, what is your middle name?”\nBen: “Jamin.”\nNovember 2012\nBen: “Is that a brain in the microwave? Are we having brains for dinner?!”\nJocelyn: “No Ben, I’m defrosting mince!!”\nDecember 2012\nIsla shouted for me twice in the night, complaining that she was being plagued by “fairy bumblebees” that were trying to peel her skin off.\nDuring the day today, I quizzed her as to why she shouted for me and not Jocelyn Nelson.\n“Because you’re better at it,” she told me.\n“Better at what?” I asked.\n“Killing the fairy bumblebees!” she replied.\nJanuary 2013\nJocelyn: “OK kids, keep your eyes out for a parent and child parking space!”\nIsla (giggling): “I know you are just joking mum! You are funny!”\nMe: “What’s so funny, Isla?”\nIsla: “They don’t really have parrot and child spaces!”\nFebruary 2013\nIsla: “When I grow up I want to be a lizard.”\nMe: “A lizard?”\nIsla: “Er, oh no… a wizard!”\nFebruary 2013\nBen: “Dad, do we have any gravy granules and teabags?”\nThis will not end well.\nMarch 2013\nIsla: “Daddy, what does W-T-F spell?”\nMarch 2013\nOn Disney Junior now transmitting in High Definition:\nIsla: “They’ve cleaned out the telly, Dad!”\nApril 2013\nMe: “Hey kids, guess when Blackpool Tower was built?”\nIsla: “Thursday?”\nMay 2013\nBen: “Dad, please can you buy me a cherry pie?”\nMe: “Sure.. do you like\ncherries?”\nBen: “Oh, it’s not a food – it’s a computer.”\nMe: “Do you mean a Raspberry Pi?”\nBen: “Yeah!”\nMay 2013\nJocelyn: “Thank you for letting me sleep in.”\nIsla: “You’re welcome Mummy. It is too cold and rainy to sleep out.”\nMay 2013\nJocelyn: “This table is filthy! Sultana bran, Weetabix, Rice Krispies… you name it, Isla has spilled it!”\nIsla (thoughtfully): “I shall name it ‘Sandra’.”\nJune 2013\nMe: “Hey kids, did you hear the thunderstorm last night?”\nIsla: “No Daddy. I heard you snoring though.”\nJuly 2013\nBen: “If you drop a piece of food on the floor for less than five seconds, you can still eat it.”\nMe: “Uh-huh. Where did you learn that?”\nBen: “At Beavers, when we were doing our ‘Healthy Eating’ badge.”\nAugust 2013\nBen: “Do you know, if there was no gravity, and all the dinosaurs went to a football pitch, the match would only last half a second.”\nSeptember 2013\nIsla: “Daddy, can I have a dot-to-dot picture of a princess?”\nMe: “Sure, here you go.”\nParenting must have been tougher before Google Images.\nOctober 2013\nBenjamin took his favourite book into school today to share with his class at “Show and Tell”.\nMe: “What did your class think of ‘The Odyssey’, Ben?”\nBen: “They thought it was epic!”\nOctober 2013\nMe: “Isla, what is your new dog called?”\nIsla: “Leash”\nNovember 2013\nMe: “Ben, your behavior today is not good for my blood pressure. Do you want me to die young?!”\nBen: “Ah, don’t be silly Dad – you’re not young!”\nNovember 2013\nIsla: “Daddy, you have got a very shiny forehead.”\nDecember 2013\nJocelyn: “Isla, would you like some almonds?”\nIsla: “Like the thing you say at the end of prayers?”\nJanuary 2014\nMe: “…and when we’re on holiday in Spain, people will talk a foreign language.”\nBen: “[friend] in my class makes the teacher feel like she’s talking a foreign language!”\nJanuary 2014\nOn the reason for Team GB’s impressive Snowboarding performance in the winter Olympics, despite the relative lack of snow and mountains on this sceptered isle:\nBen: “I guess they had a Wii when they were younger and played the Snow Resort bit of ‘Go Vacation’ a lot!”\nFebruary 2014\nMe: “Good morning Matthew!”\nMatthew: “Poo.”\nAh wonderful, we’ve taught another one to communicate.\nFebruary 2014\nBen’s homework was to write sentences containing a comparative adjective and a connective. He came up with the following:\n“Mum is old but Dad is older.”\nHmmm…\nMarch 2014\nIsla: “Daddy, for my birthday, please can I have a bucket?”\nMarch 2014\nIsla: “Pluto isn’t a planet any more, is it?”\nBen: “No, it’s an elf planet”\nMe: “I think you mean a dwarf planet Son…”\nMarch 2014\nMe: “Time to get up Ben! It’s Thursday!”\nBen: “Thursday is dead and I’m its bones.”\nMarch 2014\nOn a day trip to Bridlington beach:\nIsla: “Oh mummy, I like this rock with all the pretty colours!”\nJocelyn Nelson “Isla, that’s a lump of concrete..”\nApril 2014\nMe: “Good morning Isla”\nIsla: “Hi Daddy! I am going to have a good birthday today!”\nMe: “It’s your birthday tomorrow, it’s your party today.”\nIsla: “Oh. Which one do I get cake on?”\nApril 2014\nBen’s homework – think of ten verbs and write sentences containing them.\nMay 2014\nI went into Ben’s room to find that 21-month old Matthew had managed to climb up into Ben’s high-sleeper cabin bed.\n“Matthew Henry, how did you get up there?!” I asked with mock exasperation.\nHe looked at me as if I were an imbecile, pointed and slowly said\n“Ladder!”\nJune 2014\nWhen the broken printer that I offered on FreeCycle failed to garner any interest:\nBen: “Ah Dad, why don’t you say how good it\nis for storing paper?”\nClearly a glittering future in marketing awaits.\nJune 2014\nMatthew: “Momma – more chips, please?”\nIt’s amazing what polite linguistics one-year-olds are capable of given sufficient incentive.\nJuly 2014\nIsla: “¡Hola! Konichiwa! Edinburgh rock!”\nOne week in to our vacation, Isla’s Spanish is still somewhat lacking.\nBen, meanwhile, has mastered “patatas fritas” so he’ll survive.\nAugust 2014\nSaturday morning, 0645. It seems Matthew is slightly obsessed with the 90-second long theme tune at the end of contemporary Thomas The Tank Engine episodes.\n“Dadda, more choo-choo! Song! Crew!” (Hits me with remote control)\nAugust 2014\nAt home we keep a bunch of Thomas The Tank Engine track inside a large footstool. Here’s a photo of a frustrated Matthew discovering that not all footstools in the universe possess this property. “Track!!!”\nAugust 2014\nMe: “Isla, your bagel is ready!”\nMatthew runs into the kitchen.\nMe: “You’re not Isla. You’re Matthew.”\nIsla walks into the kitchen.\nIsla: “I’m Isla.”\nMatthew turns, pushes his sister.\nMatthew: “YOU ARE NOT ISLA! I AM ISLA!”\n#twoyearolds\nMarch 2015\nBen was uncertain as to the level of formality required when signing a Mother’s Day card.\nMarch 2015\nMatthew: “I done a poo in my sock.”\nMe: “In your SOCK?!”\nMatthew: “No! It a joke!! Ha ha ha!”\n#twoyearoldshumour\nMarch 2015\nIsla: “I’ve made a present for you daddy. It’s a rock, and I’ve drawn a picture of you on it.”\nApril 2015\nDora the Explorer: “Will YOU help me get my necklace back?”\nIsla: “Ah, maybe later Dora.”\nMay 2015\nBen: “Dad, what is this song called?”\nMe: “‘I Am The Resurrection’”.\nBen: “Ah. Please can you start a ‘favourites’ playlist for me and put this on it?”\n#parentingWin\nJune 2015\nJocelyn: “What do you think you will be when you grow up, Isla? You could be anything you want to be.”\nIsla: “A chicken.”\nOctober 2015\nMe: “What are you drawing this morning?”\nIsla: “What’s the other one that’s not heaven?”\nMe: “Hell?”\nIsla: “Yeah! I’m gonna draw that funny guy with the horns!”\nNovember 2015\nBen: “I might be a hobo when I’m older. Or a magistrate.”\nFebruary 2016\nOne the artwork for the “Happy Ash Wednesday” card she gave to Jocelyn Nelson today:\nIsla: “I didn’t know what ash looks like, so I’ve drawn a hedgehog instead.”\nFebruary 2016\nMy best birthday present came from Isla – a mostly-uneaten pack of spearmint Polos.\nMarch 2016\nMatthew: “I have matching socks! You are a good mummy!”\nMarch 2016\nMatthew: “Benny, what’s your favourite colour?”\nBen (instantly): “Light magenta.”\nMarch 2016\nMatthew: “I never knew an egg could be so much fun!”\nMarch 2016\nIsla: “Please can I smell another boiled egg?”\nMarch 2016\nMe: “You’re getting taller Matthew.”\nMatthew: “Yes, and my bottom is getting bigger!”\nMay 2016\nBen: “Dad, can we make an Excel spreadsheet listing the football stickers I have and the ones I need?”\n#proud\nMay 2016\nMe: “Good morning Princess”\nIsla: “I am not a Princess. I would much rather be a Knight. Or maybe the castle cleaner.”\nJune 2016\nMe: “Hey kids, who is this scarecrow?”\nMatthew: “Uncle Patrick!”\nJune 2016\nBen: “Dad, do you know another word for ‘pulmonology’?”\nJune 2016\nBen: “Night Dad, see you tomorrow, hopefully.”\nMe: “Hopefully? Why hopefully?”\nBen: “I dunno, you might get killed in the night or something.”\nJune 2016\nBen: “Dad, you look like a sheet of graph paper.”\nJuly 2016\nMe: “Can you smile?”\nBen: “I’m trying.”\nJuly 2016\nBen: “Isla, I’m not arguing; I’m just explaining why I’m right.”\nAugust, 2016\nAt 0645:\nMatthew: “It’s not even morning.”\nHe has a point.\nOctober 2016\nIsla: “Wi-Fi is the most valuable thing in the world!”\nNovember 2016\nMe: “What do you want for breakfast Matthew?”\nMatt: “Er, Crunchy Nuts! And Cheerios! Oh, and blueberry wheats!”\nI aim to please.\nNovember 2016\nMatthew: “Dad, can I look on the tablet for things I might want for Easter?”\nMe: “You mean Christmas.”\nMatthew: “No, I mean Easter. I have already written my Christmas list.”\nDecember 2016\nBen: “It’s great having a computer geek for a Dad.”\nJanuary 2017\nMatthew: “Daddy, will we have our new kitchen by the time I am a grown-up?”\nMy procrastination as regards home improvement projects has not gone unnoticed by the four year old.\nFebruary 2017\nThings Isla has brought to lunch #1: Duct tape\nThings Isla has brought to lunch #2 and #3: fingerless gloves and an invisible ink pen.\nApril 2017\nBen: “When we get home I’m going straight on the trampoline.”\nMatthew: “When we get home I’m going straight on Amazon.”\nJune 2017\nMe: “Do you know the word for trees that lose their leaves in the Autumn?”\nMatthew: “Yes. ‘Bare’.”\nNovember 2017\nMatthew: “Cauliflower is like limited edition white broccoli.”\nDecember 2017\nA Yuletide poem by Isla:\nChristmas\nCrackers go snap\nWhile Dad has a nap\nDad got socks\nDon’t wear Crocs\nDecember 2017\nDecided to wear a suit and tie for a change this morning.\nMatthew: “Daddy, you look like someone who isn’t in our family.”\nJanuary 2018\nIsla: “Why would you want to pay 50p for extra snot?”\nOctober 2018\nIsla: “For food and friends, we give thanks. Amen. Oh, and we hope there’s ice cream.”\nNovember 2018\n",
