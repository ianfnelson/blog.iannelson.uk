Doh! This blog entry is partly intended to prevent me from ever forgetting that again.\nHowever, it all turned out fine in the end. There were other reasons why I didn’t relish the prospect of installing TFS on the box in question – namely that it was also being used as a domain controller and SQL Server (this isn’t as bad as it sounds – the server exists solely to provide an R\u0026D development environment for a new project with demanding timescales). So, the solution I opted for was to install Virtual Server 2005 R2, and then install TFS on a virtual machine running a 32-bit OS. This worked well, as the host server was massively over-specced for the tasks at hand.\nI think virtualization is a technology whose time has really come, it certainly makes it very easy to set up development environments like this one, where the number of servers required exceeds the number of physical servers available. Occasionally I come across posts on the web from people who’re trying to install, say, TFS, SQL Server, SharePoint, and Exchange all on the same server, and getting into a pickle. Don’t do it. Embrace virtualization. Developers know all about separation of concerns when designing software solutions – try the equivalent approach when configuring your development servers.\nAs an aside – the team chose to use Conchango’s SCRUM for Team System process template, which seems to work very well, and I recommend it for anyone running a project using the SCRUM methodology. Remember, TFS is process-agnostic, you’re not limited to using MSF.\n",
