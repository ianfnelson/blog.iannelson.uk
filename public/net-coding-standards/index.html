I know this because I‚Äôve been involved in creating such documents in the past üôÇ\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm all in favour of creating clean code, and promoting standards within a team. I just find that most in-house style guides fail to achieve this, for the reasons listed above.\nSo, as I was walking through the city today, I started having a little debate with myself. ‚ÄúOK then, smarty-pants. What‚Äôs your alternative? What would your in-house coding standards guidelines look like?‚Äù\nI think it can be summarised by four simple points, listed in order of importance:\n1. Don‚Äôt Ignore Compiler Warnings You might think this would be an obvious one, but I‚Äôve lost count of the number of times I‚Äôve retrieved a solution from source control, compiled it, and been presented with a list of compiler warnings. Most of the time, there‚Äôs no excuse for this. If the compiler smells a rat in your code, then you‚Äôve got a problem, be it variables that are used without being initialized, unused variables, unreachable code, or whatever. It‚Äôs sloppy code, and it‚Äôs easily avoided, so don‚Äôt leave it for the next guy to clean up. I am, if you hadn‚Äôt guessed, a big fan of setting the ‚Äútreat compiler warnings as errors‚Äù flag in a project‚Äôs build properties.\n2. Follow the Framework Design Guidelines The Framework Design Guidelines is another one of those books whose name doesn‚Äôt do it justice. The sagely guidance it contains is appropriate not only to Microsofties developing the FCL itself, but to anyone writing any .NET code. Don‚Äôt let your developers near a copy of Visual Studio until they‚Äôve provided a sworn affidavit confirming that they‚Äôve read this book! üôÇ\nAll of the guidelines are concisely boiled down into Do, Consider, Avoid, and Do Not recommendations, and you would do well to adhere to these. Getting a few copies of this book for your team is a much more effective and cost-effective approach than trying to develop your own coding standards.\n3. Run FxCop Having read and digested the Framework Design Guidelines, you need an easy way to enforce them. This is best achieved by running FxCop against your code (now integrated into some of the Visual Studio SKUs as a ‚ÄúCode Analysis‚Äù option).\nDepending on the target audience for your solution, you may consider it reasonable to ignore some of the localization recommendations (i.e. when developing in-house line of business applications with limited geographical reach). But generally, if FxCop flags a warning in your code, I believe you would be well advised to correct the problem. Doing this helps to avoid a wide range of performance, security and design issues, in addition to enforcing consistent source code conventions.\n4. Run StyleCop Finally, if you simply must achieve that uniform source code appearance that the whitespace Nazis in every team strive for, consider requiring that your devs run their code through StyleCop before checking in. It may initially be a bit annoying, and for sure some of the recommendations are highly subjective, but there‚Äôs no arguing that it does enforce a standard style, with a strong focus on increasing readability and reducing ambiguity.\nAnd After That‚Ä¶? Following the four points above should result in the low-level codebase produced by a team being readable, of high quality, in a common style, and free of many common ‚Äúgotchas‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt validate the higher-level architectural considerations, but in my opinion that is outside the scope of such a document, and could best be achieved through the use of a tool such as NDepend. But that‚Äôs a topic for another post‚Ä¶\n",
