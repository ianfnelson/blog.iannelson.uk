[{"content":"Back in 2022, in a bid to outwit my mother in our daily Wordle battles, I wrote some C# code to explore optimal starting guesses. You can read about that experiment here.\nFast forward two years, and my Wordle addiction is alive and well. The daily challenge remains as compelling as ever, but it’s the family WhatsApp group – where scores are shared, victories boasted, and failures commiserated – that adds an extra layer of fun.\nAs 2024 winds down, I decided to dust off my coding skills and whip up a quick C# console application. The goal? To parse an export of our WhatsApp chat, gather all the shared Wordle scores, and find out if my strategies have paid off this year. Spoiler alert: they haven’t.\nIf you’ve got a similar Wordle-centric group chat with family or friends and fancy crowning your own Wordle Champion of the Year, the source code is available on GitHub: WordleParser.\nHow It Works The application takes a single argument: the path to an exported chat text file. It parses the file using a regular expression to extract anything resembling a Wordle score. Duplicate scores are weeded out, and the average family score for each calendar day is logged. For those unfortunate days when a puzzle remains unsolved, the application assigns a ‘seven’ to reflect the failure.\nThe app then aggregates scores into calendar months and years, calculating each family member’s stats for the chosen date range. Participants are ranked based on their mean difference from the average family score per day.\nFor example, if three family members scored a 4, but one managed a dazzling 2, the day’s average would be 3.5. The three “fours” would each have a daily difference of +0.5, while the lucky “two” would boast a difference of -1.5.\nThe Results So, who triumphed in the Nelson family Wordle-off this year? Did my painstaking analysis from 2022 finally give me the edge?\nReader, it did not.\nDespite my best efforts, I only just managed to sneak into second place. Predictably, my mother reigned supreme, crushing us all with an average score of 4.055 and a mean difference from the family average of -0.128. This consistency made her our undisputed Wordle Family Champion of 2024.\nImage generated using OpenAI’s DALL·E tool.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/who-reigns-supreme-parsing-our-whatsapp-chat-for-wordle-glory/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eBack in 2022, in a bid to outwit my mother in our daily Wordle battles, I wrote some C# code to explore optimal starting guesses. \u003ca href=\"https://blog.iannelson.uk/the-best-wordle-starter-words/\"\u003eYou can read about that experiment here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFast forward two years, and my Wordle addiction is alive and well.

Parsing Our WhatsApp Chat for Wordle Glory"},{"content":" As 2024 draws to a close, I’ve taken some time to reflect on the books that made the greatest impact on me this year. From deep dives into technology and politics to introspective reads on life and risk, these are the titles that enriched my year – and might just enrich yours too.\nIf you pressed me on the subject, I would say that my very favourite book of 2024 was Burn Book: A Tech Love Story by veteran tech journalist Kara Swisher.\n2024 marks thirty years since I first “got on the internet” when I was studying at university. I started out sending emails and browsing Usenet using PINE, then had my world turned upside down when NCSA Mosaic and the first versions of Netscape Navigator allowed me to start surfing the web. Since then I’ve been lucky enough to follow an enjoyable career building distributed software systems that rely on the internet.\nDuring this same period, Kara Swisher has covered that ever-changing technology sector for outlets including The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. Burn Book is a sharp, irreverent critique of the technology industry, blending memoir, satire and journalism. It delivers a candid account of tech’s rise to dominance and its often-problematic relationship with power, ethics, and accountability. Swisher doesn’t shy away from naming names, offering unfiltered takes on figures such as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and many others. There is a wealth of great anecdotes here, and no small amount of disdain for many of the man-child Silicon Valley tech bros who have changed our world so completely over the last thirty years.\nMy favourite technical book of the year was the second edition of Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems by Sam Newman, who I had the pleasure of learning from when I attended his two-day Microservices workshop at NDC Porto 2024 in October. Although ostensibly focused on Microservices, this 600-page tome offers plenty of good advice that applies more broadly to the design, implementation, and operation of any modern software system. Newman writes engagingly, backing up his candid opinions with case studies and offering concrete advice wherever possible. Highly recommended.\nAway from the code face, I’ve appreciated the insights into effective technical leadership that I have gained from two complementary books Staff Engineer: Leadership Beyond the Management Track by Will Larson and The Staff Engineer’s Path: A Guide for Individual Contributors Navigating Growth and Change by Tanya Reilly. Both offer plenty of practical advice and insights for anyone in (or aspiring to enter) a “Staff Plus” role.\nPolitics I spent some of my early summer weekends accumulating blisters as I walked the local streets delivering campaign material to help re-elect our excellent local MP Keir Mather. For background encouragement I did this while listening to the audiobook of This Time No Mistakes: How to Remake Britain by Will Hutton. It is a wide-ranging treatise covering over a century of political history on both sides of the Atlantic and attributes the UK’s current political and economic challenges to persistent adherence to free-market ideologies and minimal state intervention over the past 45 years. Drawing inspiration from early 20th-century New Liberalism and the post-1945 Labour government, Hutton advocates for a blend of ethical socialism and progressive liberalism, which he refers to as the “We Society”, balancing individual aspirations with collective welfare. Occasionally I found this a little too dry and worthy for my liking, with the recounted historical events seeming far removed from current day politics. But generally it kept me inspired and motivated, particularly in the more forward-looking sections that offered a manifesto for change.\nMy favourite book by a politician this year was only tangentially about politics. One Boy, Two Bills and a Fry-Up: A Memoir of Growing Up and Getting On is an engaging memoir by current Health Secretary Wes Streeting, recounting his experiences growing up in poverty with teenage parents who struggled to make ends meet. Despite the hardships faced, Streeting highlights the love and support from his family, and also the opportunities afforded to him by impactful teachers, ultimately leading to attending Cambridge University and embarking on a career in politics. Streeting wears his heart on his sleeve, making for a very personal memoir that offers human-centric vignettes into the factors that shaped his ideology.\nMoney and Risk I read a second autobiography this summer by another boy from a modest upbringing in East London who made a better life for himself, though this one followed a very different path from that of the Health Secretary. The Trading Game: A Confession by Gary Stevenson details the author’s ascent to become a leading trader at Citibank, working on the Short-Term Interest Rate Trading desks in London and later Tokyo. The memoir delves into the opulent yet morally ambiguous lifestyle of high finance, exposing systemic flaws and the widening wealth gap in the years that followed the 2007-8 global financial crisis. Despite his success, Stevenson grappled with the ethical implications of profiting from the economic downturns that adversely affected the less affluent, and he has since become an advocate for economic equality, using his platform to educate the public on financial disparities. I didn’t particularly relish the chapters describing bankers’ hedonism, but I was fascinated by later sections detailing the corporate games played by Citibank as Stevenson sought to leave the organisation.\nMost of us will never have the levels of money that bring the kind of ethical dilemmas faced by Gary Stevenson. For the rest of us, advice on how to manage our own more modest finances can be found in The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness by Morgan Housel. Housel argues that financial success and security is not necessarily linked to intelligence or mathematical skill but to understanding human nature and managing emotions like greed, fear, and envy. The book is written in a conversational and approachable style, combining research with 19 short stories emphasising that managing money well requires understanding yourself and your relationship with money.\nIn a similar vein, On the Edge: The Art of Risking Everything by Nate Silver digs into the psyche and strategies of individuals who thrive in high-stakes environments, from poker players to venture capitalists. He introduces the concept of “The River”, representing a community of analytical, independent-minded and risk tolerant individuals, and contrasts it with “The Village,” symbolising risk-averse, conventional thinkers. There is a huge amount of information in this book about gambling, particularly poker, which rekindled some of my interest in the game theory branch of mathematics. There are also some fascinating chapters recounting Silver’s meetings with Sam Bankman-Fried during the tumultuous period following cryptocurrency exchange FTX’s collapse and preceding his incarceration. It’s clear that Bankman-Fried had a very different relationship with risk than most of us, and this serves as a cautionary tale, illustrating the perils of risk-taking without understanding the potential consequences.\nGame-playing and risk-taking without the potential for such life-changing consequences is the subject of Around the World in 80 Games by British mathematician Marcus du Sautoy. The Jules Verne-inspired narrative circumnavigates the globe and explores a diverse array of games, from ancient board games like the Royal Game of Ur to contemporary favourite such as Settlers of Catan. It considers the cultural significance of games, and the roles they play in different societies, in addition to investigating the mathematical concepts underpinning these games, including probability, game theory and combinatorics. Du Sautoy also explores what makes games fun and interesting, captivating players into wishing for just one more turn (e.g. Wingspan, Ticket To Ride) compared to those that can drag on interminably and lead to boredom and resentment (Monopoly). In 2024 I have very much appreciated the fact that my children are of an age where they are able and willing to play decent games like 7 Wonders, Darwin’s Journey and Everdell with me, and found Du Sautoy’s book to offer pleasing insights into why we find these games so enjoyable.\nFiction As is usually the case, I read more non-fiction than fiction during the year. On the few occasions that I did pick up a novel, it seems I have been drawn to those featuring rather flawed protagonists, to say the least. American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis was, in retrospect, perhaps not the most relaxing choice of audiobook to accompany my January commutes on the congested roads of Leeds City Centre. The novel is infamous for its explicit and shocking depictions of ultra-violence, but I was more intrigued by its lengthy and monotonous monologues on 1980s bands, stereo systems, and skincare routines.\nIn the summer months (now commuting by train) I listened to the short but harrowing psychological novel We Need to Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver. Told through a series of letters written by Eva Katchadourian to her estranged husband Franklin, the story explores Eva’s attempt to make sense of their teenage son Kevin’s horrifying act of violence – a school massacre he commits shortly before his 16th birthday. The novel is a chilling and fascinating exploration of parental responsibility, societal violence, and complexities of love and blame.\nFinally, wrapping up a triptych of novels featuring notable and troubled anti-heroes, I read Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov later in the year. The unreliable narrator Humbert Humbert is charming and eloquent, seducing the reader with his wit and intellect, even as he recounts his abhorrent exploitation of a young girl. I did not realise before I began reading this book that it was originally written in English, despite Nabokov’s Russian heritage. The intricate wordplay, subtleties, and cultural references are beguiling, and I frequently felt compelled to highlight words or phrases on my Kindle for later recall. It was also a delight to recognise many turns of phrase and imagery from the lyrics of one of my favourite songs, Lolita Elle by ’90s band Jack. American imagery from Humbert and Lolita’s road trip across the United States also evoked my memories of our summer holiday driving in Utah and Nevada.\nWhile visiting the States this summer, I spent the hot Nevadan evenings sitting in the shade in my mother-in-law’s courtyard reading London Fields by Martin Amis. I had previously tried reading Amis in my early twenties, encouraged to do so by my intellectual and more literary-minded housemate Hugh. But at the time I found Amis’s prose to be dense and challenging, and it said little to me about my life at the time (back then I preferred the lighter fin de siècle ennui of Douglas Coupland). But on returning to Amis’ “London Trilogy” in my forties, I find myself relishing these dark satires of modern life, the deeply flawed characters, and the way that the cities of London and New York symbolise both opportunity and corruption. Most of all I love the gloriously esoteric words and the lovingly-crafted sentences, many of which I again highlighted on my Kindle. Having re-read Money in 2018 and London Fields this year, I plan to revisit The Information in 2025.\nPeople? People are chaotic quiddities living in one cave each. They pass the hours in amorous grudge and playback and thought-experiment. At the camp fire they put the usual fraction on exhibit, and listen to their own silent gibber about how they’re feeling and how they’re going down. We’ve been there.\nMartin Amis, London Fields\nMusic My favourite music book of the year was Deliver Me From Nowhere: The Making of Bruce Springsteen’s Nebraska by Warren Zanes. In contrast to the rock autobiographies by Bono, Jarvis Cocker, and Dave Grohl that have graced my year-end blog post in recent years and which contain a wide-range of anecdotes, Zanes’ book focuses on one specific recording. The Nebraska LP, recorded solo on a four-track cassette recorder in a New Jersey bedroom, was a stark departure from Springsteen’s earlier, more grandiose works. It showcased a raw, introspective side, and featured narratives of violence, despair, and existential contemplation. Zanes is a true fan and diligent researcher, who through interviews with Springsteen and others explores how Nebraska challenged industry norms and left a lasting impact on music, paving the way for future generations of lo-fi and indie rock artists to produce music in their bedrooms. For a broader read, I also enjoyed R.E.M. Album by Album by Max Pilley, a comprehensive retrospective of the thirty-year recording career of one of my favourite bands. This featured many facts and insights into the band and music that I wasn’t previously aware of, and led to me streaming their LPs with fresh ears, not unlike the impact that Revolution In The Head by Ian McDonald once had upon my appreciation of The Beatles’ recordings.\nLife and How to Live It Fluke: Chance, Chaos, and Why Everything We Do Matters by Dr. Brian Klaas explores the influence of randomness and chaos on human lives and decision-making. Klaas examines how small, seemingly insignificant events – flukes – can cascade into pivotal moments, shaping the course of history, politics, and personal trajectories.\nThe book examines topics like the butterfly effect, exploring how initial conditions can lead to wildly unpredictable outcomes, and the role of luck versus skill in success and failure. Klaas uses vivid anecdotes from history, science, and contemporary life to demonstrate how randomness interacts with human agency, often creating illusions of control where none exists.\nDespite acknowledging the pervasive role of chance, this book ultimately offers a hopeful perspective: while randomness is unavoidable, our actions still matter. By understanding the mechanics of chaos and probability, we can better navigate uncertainty, make informed decisions, and cultivate resilience. There was a lot to take in here; much food for thought, and it’s one of the books from 2024 that I would definitely consider reading again in an attempt to digest the salient and actionable points.\nOne of the books mentioned in my 2021 post was Four Thousand Weeks: Time And How to Use It by Oliver Burkeman. He has returned with the follow-up Meditations for Mortals: Four Weeks to Embrace Your Limitations and Make Time for What Counts, and I’ve found it to be even more inspirational and actionable than the previous book. It is structured as a four-week “mental retreat” of daily meditations, centred around the topics of “Being Finite”, “Taking Action”, “Letting Go” and “Showing Up”. As someone who often struggles to decide what to do with my free time, and has been trying to find more efficient “algorithms to live by” for many years, I took great comfort from some of the poignant and reflective advice in the short chapters in this book, which is excellently researched and includes plenty of source citations to further reading. The “index of afflictions” at the back of the book is also a helpful resource.\nI have thoroughly enjoyed all of Professor Cal Newport’s books, but his latest work, Slow Productivity: The Lost Art of Accomplishment without Burnout is my favourite to date, and is unsurprisingly focused, as you would expect from a book that exhorts us to do fewer things and obsess over quality. Newport highlights the unfortunate rise of performative busywork in modern corporate culture, and the negative impact that this has had on the creation of quality outputs. It goes on to suggest strategies and tactics that knowledge workers and others with a reasonable degree of autonomy in their jobs can use to live more fulfilling lives and produce higher-quality work. Alas, it does come with the caveat that many people who work in an office environment under close supervision might have a hard time fully instituting the strategies suggested: there will always be employers and clients who prioritise bureaucracy and infantilising processes over genuine productivity. But it offers the prospect of better ways of working to those who can do so, and I am hopeful that these ideas will spread across the corporate world as the benefits of their adoption are seen.\nDo fewer things.\nWork at a natural pace.\nObsess over quality.\nCal Newport, Slow Productivity\nIn 2024 I read more books than usual by reducing the amount of mainstream news media and social media that I consumed. I found this to be a more rewarding balance and it had a positive effect of my mental health. Yet even reading just one quality national newspaper per week left me with the impression that the world was going to hell in a hand cart, and by October I deliberately sought out a book to read that would offer some optimism. I found it in Humankind: A Hopeful History by Rutger Bregman, a thought-provoking exploration of human nature that challenges the assumption that humans are fundamentally selfish and driven by greed.\nBregman’s central thesis is that humans are, by nature, “Homo puppy” – inherently friendly, cooperative, and capable of incredible kindness. He invites readers to adopt a more optimistic lens on humanity, rejecting cynicism and building systems that empower our better angels. I particularly enjoyed the sections of the book where Bregman’s fresh research debunked iconic studies like the Stanford Prison Experiment and Milgram Experiment, revealing flaws in their methodology and reporting. The book is a mixture of rigorous research and engaging anecdotes that offers a call to action to reimagine our social structures and advocates for policies such as Universal Basic Income, which assume the best in people and trust individuals to act responsibly.\nOur World Similarly optimistic was the excellent Not the End of the World: How We Can Be the First Generation to Build a Sustainable Planet by Dr Hannah Ritchie. This data-driven exploration of the environmental challenges facing the planet was very reminiscent of Factfulness: Ten Reasons We’re Wrong About The World – And Why Things Are Better Than You Think by the late Swedish academic Hans Rosling. It challenges common misconceptions, scrutinising the actual impact of actions like eating locally and the true environmental costs of materials such as plastic. Ritchie emphasises that, contrary to pervasive doomsday narratives, we have the potential to achieve true sustainability for the first time in history.\nIf Ritchie’s work relies on accurate data to draw conclusions, what are the impacts on public policy when data is non-existent, inaccurate or misleading? That is the subject of Bad Data: How Governments, Politicians and the Rest of Us Get Misled by Numbers by Georgina Sturge, a statistician at the House of Commons Library. The book dives into the murky waters of official statistics, revealing how data – often assumed to be the bedrock of informed policy-making – is riddled with inconsistencies, guesswork, and uncertainties. It offers insightful analysis and engaging storytelling through a series of compelling narratives, which often served to provoke and anger me in a manner not dissimilar to that of Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men by Caroline Criado Perez, which featured in my blog post of 2019.\nAnother book on public policy that got me angry and worked up in 2024 was The Big Con: How the Consulting Industry Weakens our Businesses, Infantilises our Governments and Warps our Economies by Mariana Mazzucato and Rosie Collington. Through a series of case studies it critiques how large consulting firms have entrenched themselves as indispensable advisors while simultaneously undermining the very organisations they serve. Exhaustively highlighting the dependency culture, short-termism and lack of accountability that inevitably arises, the book calls for a reevaluation of the consulting industry’s role in modern organisations and governments. It advocates for rebuilding in-house expertise and fostering a culture of long-term value creation, rather than outsourcing core functions to external advisors.\nMy favourite science book of the year was Material World: A Substantial Story of Our Past and Future by Ed Conway, the economics editor for Sky News. He focuses on six fundamental materials – sand, salt, iron, copper, oil, and lithium – that have been instrumental in shaping human civilisation, and continue to be important for all our futures. The book highlights the many ways that these materials underpin modern life: sand is essential for silicon chips, iron and copper are foundational to construction and electrical infrastructure, and lithium is vital for contemporary battery technologies. The context of the transition to renewable energy sources and the demand that it will place on our consumption of these materials weighs heavily on the narrative.\nWe have come full circle. My books round-up blog post for 2024 ends on the same topic that it began – the impact of new technologies. If the technological changes that we have seen over the last 30 years have been remarkable, they are nothing compared to those that we are about to witness over the coming decades. The Coming Wave: Technology, Power and the Twenty-First Century’s Greatest Dilemma by DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman covers the transformative impact of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), synthetic biology and quantum computing on society. It explores how those technological advancements could lead to immense prosperity while simultaneously posing enormous threats to global order and individual freedoms. Notably, Suleyman highlights the “containment problem”, arguing for proactive measures by nation states to strike a balance between innovation and potential catastrophe. At a time when the full potential of technologies such as ChatGPT and synthetic biology have not yet been grasped by the majority, The Coming Wave offers an urgent wake-up call. An important read.\nThank you for reading this far!

Having been a freelancer since 2008, it’s often difficult to justify taking time out to attend conferences, no matter how valuable they might be to one’s career in the longer term. The face cost of the conference ticket is usually dwarfed by the loss of contract income (real or perceived) whilst being unable to bill a client.\nBut circumstances conspired to make my attendance at NDC Porto possible this year. Firstly, I’m currently doing some exclusive and inside IR35 work for a client, which effectively results in me having some mandatory days off to play with for the first time in over 15 years. And secondly, I was lucky enough to win an all-access pass to any NDC Conference at a raffle held at the last DDD North event this March – so many thanks to the good folk at Black Marble for organising that event, and to NDC for offering the prize.\nI had never been to Porto before, so took the opportunity to spend the weekend prior to the conference doing the tourist thing. The October weather was fantastic for walking around the historic city centre, taking in the cathedral, Torre dos Clérigos, and views of the Duoro river. My goodness, but it’s hilly though!\nFrom my journal that Sunday:\nWorkshop – Designing Microservices Before the conference proper began on Wednesday, there were nine two-day workshops to choose from. I opted to attend Designing Microservices by Sam Newman. I had previously read Sam’s book Building Microservices, and have been using microservices of some variety or other on projects since 2018. While these have sometimes been successful, I have often had the niggling doubt that some implementations on which I have worked could more accurately be described as being Distributed Monoliths, and I was eager to spend some focused time understanding when the lure of microservices should be resisted, and to dig into implementation patterns, along with examining related topics such as whether to use multirepo or monorepo approaches for source control.\nAs with Sam’s book, while ostensibly about microservices, the workshop also covered a wide range of more general architectural and software development topics that could be equally applied to traditional monoliths. It also struck a good balance between technical topics and organisational ones – how to structure teams for success when delivering a microservice-based solution. I appreciated this holistic coverage, as well as the tacit admission that microservice architectures may often not be the correct solution for a given project.\nThe workshop was delivered at a good pace, neither labouring points unnecessarily, nor glossing over more thorny topics that were worthy of due consideration. There was a good mixture of slides, dialogue, and some collaborative activity in small groups.\nMy only minor disappointment with the two-day workshop was a sense that a small minority of the other attendees were insufficiently engaged – returning late to the workshop room from our plentiful breaks, and checking their phones frequently. I assume they were attending at the behest of their employer rather than of their own volition, but this behaviour seemed disrespectful to Sam and the other attendees. I tried to ignore it.\nMy 10 Favourite Sessions After the initial two days of workshops, the remaining three days were filled with over a hundred traditional one-hour sessions, with up to six sessions running concurrently. This led to sometimes difficult decisions about which sessions to attend. My strategy was generally to attend sessions covering higher-level broad-brush type topics, rather than those covering niche technologies which I could learn through reading online documentation. But even within these self-imposed guidelines, there was a wealth of material to choose from. I attended around twenty sessions – here are some thoughts on my favourite ten:\nKeynote: Tidy First? A Daily Exercise in Empirical Design by Kent Beck The conference proper opened on Wednesday morning with a Keynote by Kent Beck, the creator of extreme programming, early proponent of Test-Driven Development, and one of the 17 original signatories to the Agile Manifesto. Like all the keynotes, this took place in the huge main expo hall of the conference. I can see the logistical logic behind this decision – notably that it is large enough to house all of the delegates, and ensures that the conference can kick off at 9am sharp, even if latecomers are still arriving. But on the downside there were no seats close to the stage area (I am 48 years old, the prospect of standing up for an hour didn’t appeal), whereas from the area with seats it was a struggle to hear Kent over the background chatter and espresso machines. I would learn from my mistakes and prop myself up on a table near the front for the following days’ keynotes.\nMy geriatric grumblings notwithstanding, from the portions I heard properly, this was a great talk, and I look forward to rewatching this on YouTube to fill in the gaps. Unlike every other session that I saw during the week, Kent did not have a traditional slide deck, but instead projected some freeform sketches to illustrate the concepts he discussed.\nThere was much talk about the perennial topics (and personal bugbears) of estimation, and the cost of software development, and how software designers can influence when money is spent and earned. The concept of optionality was introduced – if software can be changed, then the design does not matter. Features are easy to see, but options are difficult to see, yet this is why we invest in software. The cost of software is the cost of changing it, not the cost of building it. Some changes are surprisingly expensive, yet others are surprisingly cheap.\nSome of my favourites quotes from the session (of which there were many, some of which would appear in the slides of other speakers later in the week):\nKent wrapped up with a few words on this year’s hot topic of AI. He drew parallels with the development of highly efficient steam engines during the Industrial Revolution, and explained how this had actually led to an increase in the use of coal (the Jevon’s Paradox). He offered that the AIs are not coming for our jobs any time soon and that we are, in fact entering a new golden age for programming. This topic would crop up again throughout the conference.\nBeing Staff Plus by Ian Cooper Having now notched up 27 years at the code face, I have recently been giving some considerations as to where to take my career in the coming years, without having to sell my soul to the devil and venture over to the dark side of management. This session from Ian Cooper on “Staff Plus” roles offered some great advice on the nature of senior technical leadership roles, and how to “move beyond code” while staying resolutely technical.\nIan offered a good balance of high-level strategic career advice married with a bunch of helpful tactical hints and tips for how to succeed (and demonstrate that success) in such roles, and I urge any other greybeards feeling frustrated with their careers to watch this presentation (the version from NDC Oslo is online here).\nThis was the first session that sent me scurrying to Amazon to buy some recommended books (it would not be the last!). By the time I got home to England on Saturday both The Staff Engineer’s Path: A Guide for Individual Contributors Navigating Growth and Change by Tanya Reilly and Staff Engineer: Leadership Beyond the Management Track by Will Larson would be waiting for me.\nDefinition Of Insanity – Timeouts, retries, and idempotency by Sam Newman This session by Sam Newman focused on some of key techniques for developing resilient distributed systems: Timing out remote calls that do not complete in a timely fashion, Retrying unsuccessful calls, and how to achieve idempotency to ensure that calls can be retried safely without undesirable side-effects.\nThis topic is highly relevant to a distributed system that I am developing for my current client, so I listened intently and appreciated the detailed low-level advice. I was particularly interested in the observation that if a retry of an idempotent request succeeds, we should send back the same semantic response that we would have sent had the original request succeeded. Also new to me was the concept of a Bloom Filter.\nImproving the resilience of distributed systems has been an interest of mine since reading the first edition of Release It! by Michael Nygard in 2009. I’m delighted to see that Sam is currently authoring a new book on this topic, due for publication in 2025.\nOpen Source, Open Mind: The Cost of Free Software by Dylan Beattie A light-hearted talk to end the first day of the conference, this session by Dylan Beattie was a whistle-stop tour of the history of open source software, covering notable successes, failures and lawsuits, followed by some thoughts on where “free software” goes from here.\nA recording of an earlier version of this talk from NDC Oslo 2024 is available online, but Dylan had added extra material to the talk since then to cover the recent disputes between WordPress.com owners Automattic and WP Engine.\nKeynote: Can you trust your (large language) model? by Jodie Burchell Thursday’s keynote by data scientist Jodie Burchell talked about how the quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has been measured, and highlighted structural deficiencies with both the benchmarks as well as the AI tooling themselves. I confess to not having devoted much time over the past year to understanding the “AI revolution”, so did not know what to expect from this talk, but I found it a fascinating and highly approachable explanation that has piqued my interest. My contemporary notes from this session read “Such a good talk. Chase down the slides, and sessions from earlier NDCs“.\nOrchestration vs. Choreography: The good, the bad, and the trade-offs by Laïla Bougriâ Designing distributed systems regularly involves trying to decide between synchronous or asynchronous communication, and orchestration or choreography (and the combinations thereof). There are, of course, tradeoffs to make, but the design decisions are often made when considering only the happy path scenarios.\nThis excellent talk by Laïla Bougriâ took this complex nuanced subject, with all of its “it depends” messiness, and offered concrete guidance for when and how to implement each approach. One of my favourite sessions of the whole conference, and Laïla coped excellently with audio problems for the first third of the presentation.\nA Developer Goes to the Movies by Simon Painter Thursday, the middle day of the conference proper, was a long one, but fortunately there were some great light-hearted talks later in the day to balance those that required more intense thinking.\nI had previously enjoyed seeing Simon Painter give his talk “From Ancient Greeks to Modern Geeks: Basic Machine Learning Algorithms” at DDD North in Hull in March 2024. For this new talk, he brings together his twin passions of movies and coding by presenting a visual history of computing and software developers as seen by Hollywood.\nI don’t seem to have made as many notes on this talk, preferring to relax and enjoy the show (though sadly without popcorn), but I do recall enjoying the segments on WarGames, The Net and Hackers (which I really must watch again soon). It was also intriguing to learn that the distinction for the first person to have portrayed a computer hacker in a movie goes to none other than Benny Hill!\nHow Simple Is “As Simple As Possible”? by Rendle Rendle has been doing this programming lark for even longer than me. But unlike me (who merely grumbles about our industry through the medium of Instagram memes shared with equally bitter colleagues), Rendle is an ex-professional standup comic who takes the grumbling to a whole new level by holding up a (black) mirror to our industry in conference presentations such as this one.\nThe thing is, as the saying goes, it’s funny because it’s true. Rendle is on a mission to highlight how unnecessarily complex we have made most aspects of software design, development and deployment during his career, and proselytise for an easier, simpler and more productive life. Amen to that.\nKeynote: Start Here: Mindset Shifts and Tools for Building Career Confidence in a Post-Pandemic Era by Denise Jacobs For Friday’s final keynote of the conference, I took my now-customary standing spot up front near the stage… and then immediately regretted it as I noticed the pens and paper dotted around the tables. I realised with horror that this was going to be an interactive session, and considered retreating to the back of the room. I do not generally enjoy audience participation, have no “fun facts” on hand to share about myself, and abhor “icebreakers” at the start of meetings and workshops.\nBut, I told myself that I had come all this way to Porto with the intention of adopting a growth mindset and learning as much as possible, so ought to give it a go. I’m glad I did, as Denise’s talk became one of my favourite of the conference, and the audience participation exercises (which were not as scary as I had feared) helped to boost my confidence and further renew my interest in my career.\nI ordered yet another book recommendation on the back of this talk – Chatter: The Voice in Our Head and How to Harness It by Ethan Kross, but opted for Audible this time to reduce the number of Amazon packages that would be arriving at home in my absence.\nThe Next Decade of Software Development by Richard Campbell Richard Campbell is best known to me as the co-host of the .NET Rocks! podcast, but his interest and expertise in science, computing, and technology is far broader than that niche (he gave another talk at this conference on the topic of Nuclear Power).\nThis talk on the Next Decade of Software Development has been presented many times over the years and been regularly updated as new trends such as the Cloud emerge and gradually become mainstream. It reviews where we’ve been, examines the trend lines, and looks forward to which trends and technologies we will need to learn to remain relevant in our roles in the upcoming years. As with many of the other talks, this naturally touched on AI, and joined that consensus that we are entering a period where the LLMs will aid our software development work rather than directly threatening it. At a more prosaic level, Richard was also positive that .NET and Blazor are not going anywhere any time soon.\nFinal Thoughts I thoroughly enjoyed my time at NDC Porto. The conference is expertly organised by a team who have clearly been doing this for quite some time. The venue – a former customshouse on the banks of the Duoro – was airy and inspirational. The complementary food and drink was delicious and plentiful. The speakers were knowledgeable and friendly, making themselves available for questions outside of the sessions themselves. Generally I found my fellow attendees to be amiable and approachable, and appreciated mingling amongst the wide variety of nationalities present from across the European continent and further afield. I remain disheartened by the male skew in the gender balance of attendees at tech conferences, but it was pleasing to note how many (excellent) female speakers gave talks – I suspect and hope that NDC are doing all they reasonably can to improve diversity.\nI return home to Yorkshire, and back to the code face, with a renewed enthusiasm for my chosen career and a rekindled excitement for technologies (both new and old – some of the talks by Anders Norås have made me nostalgic for my Amiga 500 and 1200!). Oh, and with an ever-growing pile of books to read!\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/ndc-porto-2024/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI had the pleasure of spending ISO Week 42 in the beautiful Portuguese coastal city of Porto, attending the NDC Porto 2024 conference for software developers by \u003ca href=\"https://ndcconferences.com/\"\u003eNDC Conferences\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s been a long time since I attended a multi-day conference – perhaps even as long ago as \u003ca href=\"https://blog.iannelson.uk/software-architect-2007/\"\u003eSoftware Architect 2007\u003c/a\u003e (where I first learned about Dependency Injection and IOC Containers) which makes me feel quite ancient. Having been a freelancer since 2008, it’s often difficult to justify taking time out to attend conferences, no matter how valuable they might be to one’s career in the longer term. The face cost of the conference ticket is usually dwarfed by the loss of contract income (real or perceived) whilst being unable to bill a client.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"NDC Porto 2024"},{"content":"Politics on the Edge: A Memoir from Within by Rory Stewart My very favourite book of 2023 was this autobiography by former Minister and one-time candidate for Conservative Party leader Rory Stewart. I almost didn’t read it at all, as I was feeling a little jaded with politics at the time and considering a more light-hearted Audible purchase. I’m glad I plumped for this though, and it did offer some light relief in the form of Stewart’s dodgy accents when recounting conversations with fellow politicians of all parties and nationalities.\nThere is no flab in this book, it ploughs on at quite a fast pace through Stewart’s political career, from becoming MP for Penrith and the Border in 2010 through to his run for leader of the Conservative Party (and Prime Minister) less than a decade later. In between he is thrust with no notice into a variety of ministerial positions for which he has varying degrees of suitability and aptitude. In my 2019 books blog post I recommended the drier Why We Get the Wrong Politicians by Isabel Hardman, in which she outlined why the failings of our ministerial system lead to roles being filled by individuals who are unsuited to them. Stewart’s book brings colourful examples of that theory, but to his credit he makes efforts to master the briefs he is given and make a practical difference to the country. Others from his party, particularly our recent Prime Ministers, are not always painted in a positive light, and he gives many interesting insights into their personalities.\nTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin In 2023 I rediscovered the pleasure of playing computer games, eighteen years after writing a fairly grumpy blog post in which I declared that “The whole concept seemed utterly pointless, a real waste of time“. A spring break between contracts coincided with the release of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which I bought on a whim after stumbling across Keza MacDonald’s effusive five-star review in The Guardian. Since then I’ve spent 167 hours playing that wonderful game, and have also relaxed by playing Creaks on Apple Arcade and Return to Monkey Island (32 years after playing the original on the Amiga).\nIt was with this background that I that I read Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow towards the end of the year. It’s a novel set over several decades about two friends who collaborate to develop and publish increasingly epic computer games whilst navigating romances, friendship, fallouts, family, health challenges, and other life-changing events. It’s very touching and heartfelt, and caused me to think about the value of play in our lives, and of maintaining friendships over extended periods.\nSurrender: 40 Songs, One Story by Bono Faced with a “to-read” list that now numbers into the seventies, I made a point of actively abandoning some books that I was not enjoying during 2023, rather than struggling through them to the bitter end. As my wife Jocelyn is fond of reminding me, life is too short to read books that you’re not enjoying. Cognisant of my maturing years and the theories of Optimal Stopping, I’ve also tended to stick to favourite genres this year rather than trying something new.\nSo, given that I enjoy biographies, and also enjoy books on rock music, Bono’s autobiography was always destined to be high on my list of favourite reads for the year. It covers U2’s lengthy career from their early schooldays in Dublin through to being the biggest band in the world, releasing classic zeitgeist-defining records including The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. There is an impressive cast of supporting characters mentioned in the many anecdotes in this book, including Pope John Paul II, Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Frank Sinatra, and countless others. At one point Mikhail Gorbachev pops in for tea on a Sunday afternoon.\nA Visit from the Goon Squad and The Candy House by Jennifer Egan These two books were released in 2010 and 2022 respectively, and feature interrelated stories with a large set of characters, set over multiple decades. Many of the central characters work in the rock music industry, and there are themes here of friendship, aging, and loss of innocence. The first book (which won a Pulitzer Prize) is probably the better one, but the audiobook of the second has better production qualities, with each POV character being narrated by a different professional voice artist. The second book also bursts with inspired ideas about where the ubiquity of social media might take us as a society.\nOne Two Three Four: The Beatles In Time by Craig Brown A huge book comprised of many short and easily-digestible chapters that occupied much of my summer vacation. Craig Brown somehow takes a subject, The Beatles, about whom so very much has been written over the last sixty years and offers fresh perspectives and anecdotes. I laughed a lot and found myself sharing passages with family and friends. Definitely one of the most enjoyable biographies I’ve ever read and, along with Revolution in the Head by Ian MacDonald, one of the best books about The Beatles.\nThe Nanny State Made Me: A Story of Britain and How to Save It and The Full English: A Journey in Search of a Country and its People by Stuart Maconie Two books by DJ Stuart Maconie make my list of favourites this year. The Nanny State Made Me iterates through stages in Maconie’s life, highlighting how at each point the welfare state in the UK provided him with the necessary support to become a useful and productive member of society. As with most Maconie books the politics is interspersed with an abundance of cultural references, and this helped to boost my “to watch”/”to listen” lists.\nIn The Full English, Maconie retraces a journey through England originally taken by J.B.Priestley in his travelogue English Journey in 1934, comparing and contrasting how the nation has changed in the intervening decades. Despite acknowledging that there is much that needs improving in England, there is also a love and sentimentality for the nation in evidence here. I was surprised to learn that Maconie’s father used to work for the same now-defunct manufacturer that employed my own Dad, so felt quite connected to those passages. I was also amused to hear him, as a proud Lancastrian, extol the virtues of Ilkley and admit that he could conceive of living there.\nThe Anthropocene Reviewed by John Green In this series of essays adapted from his podcast, novelist John Green reviews and rates things as diverse as sunsets, Diet Dr Pepper, the song New Partner by Palace Music, the Indianapolis 500, Halley’s Comet and the QWERTY keyboard. Many of these pieces were written with the backdrop of the 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic, but the inevitable ensuing introspection does not result in morbidity, instead conveying hope and wonder at how miraculous the universe is. I give The Anthropocene Reviewed four stars.\nWhite Noise by Don DeLillo The oldest book on my list this year, White Noise was written in 1985. Some of the characters and events depicted seemed oddly familiar – maybe it’s deja vu, but I can’t preclude having read this book previously and forgotten having done so!\nI enjoyed this more than Great Jones Street, also by DeLillo, which I read in 2019 but which didn’t make my annual blog post that year. It is written in the first person from the POV of the protagonist, a male middle-aged college professor in a sleepy American town who has developed the field of “Hitler Studies”. Despite being almost forty years old, it covers themes of consumer culture, academia and mortality which remain relevant.\nThe Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music by Dave Grohl Another rock autobiography, and a brilliant collection of stories. Dave Grohl comes across as a very humble and lucky individual who can’t quite believe his good fortune at being a driving force behind some of the most successful bands in the world. There is an ordinariness to Grohl’s tales that is quite striking when compared to Bono’s book. Extended passages and chapters are given over to (surprisingly entertaining) anecdotes about losing a wallet at a gas station, or shopping for toys with his daughters. Yes, there’s a cast of famous names – Paul McCartney pops round to play the piano – but it’s all so natural and down to earth that you can’t begrudge Grohl his good fortune.\nAtonement by Ian McEwan I knew nothing about the plot of this novel before I started reading it; I certainly hadn’t seen the 2007 movie adaptation. I don’t consider myself to generally be a fan of historical novels, preferring those set within my own lifetime. But I found this to have terrific pace and well-drawn characters, and devoured it over the course of a weekend in May.\nA Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout Most of the tech books that I read in 2023 were focused on specific technologies, as I moved on from a much-loved five-year contract at NHS Digital and had to grok an unfamiliar tech stack. This delightful and relatively short book was one of the only tech-agnostic software books that I read, and I wish that it had been available to me much earlier in my career.\nOusterhout writes engagingly about complex software design topics, offering opinions and philosophies for an approach to development that can sometimes be at odds with that espoused in the better-known Clean Code by Robert Martin. I know that I won’t follow all of the advice given in this philosophy (I’ve never been a fan of code comments, for instance), but have taken to heart chapters on writing general purpose modules, and “different layer, different abstraction”.\nAs I write this I note that it is flagged on Amazon as being one of the “Most Gifted” books in the Software Design genre, and that doesn’t surprise me – it’s a book that I would like those who I collaborate with to have read and absorbed.\nWhy Is This Lying Bastard Lying To Me? Searching for the Truth on Political TV by Rob Burley Rob Burley is a TV producer who has worked on and edited many of the top political shows on the BBC and ITV. In this entertaining and irreverent book he dissects what makes for a great political interview, and relives many memorable moments from Sunday morning political programmes, particularly covering recent years since the Brexit referendum.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/the-books-i-most-enjoyed-reading-in-2023/","summary":"\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"politics-on-the-edge-a-memoir-from-within-by-rory-stewart\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://amzn.to/41sIGYS\"\u003ePolitics on the Edge: A Memoir from Within\u003c/a\u003e by Rory Stewart\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy very favourite book of 2023 was this autobiography by former Minister and one-time candidate for Conservative Party leader Rory Stewart.

Email me at ian@iannelson.uk\nWhat I’ve Been Doing Recently Since March 2018 I’ve been a Technical Lead for the NHS App, an England-wide way to access a range of NHS services via smartphone, tablet, and desktop web browser. It has been an amazing project to be a part of, and I’ve loved working in an open, collaborative, and agile delivery environment alongside a bunch of clever people from NHS Digital, Kainos, and BJSS.\nI’ve led an ever-changing, multi-disciplinary team through over 120 fortnightly sprints — a period that saw the App’s user base grow from nothing to over thirty million users, and become the most downloaded app in the App Store during the COVID-19 pandemic years.\nI’ve led the design and development of the App’s notification and messaging capability, which allows the secure and sub second delivery of health-related communications from NHS organisations to patient’s mobile devices, replacing more costly communication methods such as SMS or mail.\nIn case it’s not obvious, I’m pretty proud of what we’ve achieved on the NHS App over the past five years, and could write much more. But I’ll save that for a future blog post and return to the sales pitch…\nWhat I Do Generally I am a hands-on Technical Architect / Technical Lead. I draw boxes and arrows on (real and virtual) whiteboards, and talk about those designs with teams, allowing us to collaboratively bring maintainable, performant and scalable solutions into existence.\nI am detail-oriented and still a developer at heart. I like to stay close to the codebase. I am not an Architecture Astronaut. I prefer developing backend code to frontend. I am comfortable taking ownership of systems and communicating with people at all levels of an organisation.\nThe Technology I Use I have over 20 years’ experience of C# and .NET development, from the betas through to C#10 and .NET Core 6.0 (but I still have to occasionally Google how to properly implement the IDisposable pattern).\nI have been working with Azure products for, gosh, it must be over a decade now. I have spent significant time wrangling with App Services, Function Apps, Cosmos DB (Mongo and (No)SQL), Event Hubs, SQL Database, Kubernetes Service and Service Bus. I have found and reported a bug to the Notification Hub product team, and been mailed a t-shirt by the Cognitive Search team in response to my feedback.\nI favour distributed architectures that are loosely-connected by messaging patterns and RESTful APIs. I am vaguely suspicious of the rush towards Microservices. I am a bit disappointed that the end of the relational database hegemony means that I no longer get to use my SQL skills on a daily basis, but have replaced this with a new-found admiration for Splunk queries.\nHow I Work I prefer to code in the open and work in the open. I favour public Slack channels over DMs. I appreciate the DevOps culture where all members of the team are empowered to make changes to a collective codebase. I think infrastructure as code is one of the game-changing trends of the last decade.\nI still quite like Test-Driven Development, but am learning to be more pragmatic about when it is applied, and when to use chunkier integration tests.\nI am a Microsoft Registered Partner, but do all my work on a MacBook.\nI care very much about the quality of the solutions that I help to create, but I try to inject levity and humour into the working day, and do not take myself too seriously.\nI like to break up lengthy blog posts with photos of my dog.\nMore Randomness My favourite software books of all time include Working Effectively with Legacy Code, Domain-Driven Design, and Release It!\nMy favourite GoF design patterns are Visitor and Chain of Responsibility.\nSome people that I’ve worked with have written nice things about me, and I didn’t even have to pay them. You can read a collection of these endorsements on my testimonials page.\nSound Good? I hope you’ve enjoyed reading these insights into my psyche and skills.

But the scope of Hari’s work is much broader than these. Rather than merely telling us to stop doomscrolling Twitter and get on with life, he covers a multiplicity of factors and forces that are combining to steal the ability of many of us to focus. Social media, pollution, lack of sleep, poor diet, overwork and more are all discussed, with many pointers to third-party research.\nDespite the breadth and serious nature of the subject matter, I should note that some aspects of this book are also laugh-out-loud funny. I particularly enjoyed an early anecdote about Hari witnessing visitors to the Graceland museum experiencing Elvis Presley’s home by fixating on a VR iPad tour, rather than looking around the actual room in which they were standing.\nGood Pop Bad Pop by Jarvis Cocker When I was in my twenties I couldn’t fathom the appeal of biographies. Why, I reasoned, would I want to waste my time reading about one individual out of the billions who had lived or would ever live? Surely it would be more efficient to read distilled human knowledge on a much broader subject?\nWell, I’m not sure exactly when I changed my opinion on this, but I must have done so because I now find myself reading several biographies each year, and they frequently appear atop my end-of-year blog posts. Other celebrity autobiographies that I enjoyed in 2022 were The Gift of a Radio: My Childhood and Other Train Wrecks by broadcaster Justin Webb, and Coal Black Mornings by Suede frontman Brett Anderson.\nThe concept behind Cocker’s autobiography (or “inventory”) is that he cleaned out an attic space during the Covid lockdowns, deciding whether to “keep or cob” accumulated treasures/junk. This provides a conceit for many entertaining anecdotes about his life growing up in Sheffield and becoming lead singer of Pulp, all written in a most idiosyncratic style. Highlights for me included a detailed explanation of how he came to be hospitalised after fall out of a window while trying to impress a girl, and a wonderful piece on interviewing the late Leonard Cohen during his time as a BBC Radio 6 Music DJ.\nI was sorely tempted to get the audiobook of this to hear Jarvis’s own narration, but plumped for the hardback instead which is wonderfully typeset and illustrated with many photographs of the items saved from the loft.\nSkyfaring: A Journey With a Pilot by Mark Vanhoenacker This was a present from my wife Jocelyn for Christmas 2021. I had not been previously aware of it, so was pleasantly surprised when it became one of my favourite books of the year.\nVanhoenacker is a commercial airline pilot who has flown short-haul and long-haul routes for British Airways from a base in London to cities all over the world. He writes engagingly and romantically about all aspects of flying – the machines, the processes and procedures, the navigation systems, but mostly how it feels to transport and be transported so rapidly across space and time.\nThe prose is ethereal and dreamlike, in a manner not dissimilar to the jet lag and “place lag” that it describes. Vanhoenacker captures well the magic of aviation and inspires a desire to travel once again, following years of Covid lockdowns.\nThe Outrun by Amy Liptrot This is a fascinating memoir by Amy Liptrot who, at the age of thirty, left behind the life she lived as an alcoholic in London to return to her childhood home of Orkney. Her sublime writings about the path to recovery amongst the peaceful nature of the islands are quite hypnotic, and spoke to me, particularly the sections about gradually building new and better habits over time.\nNourishing and inspiring, this book is the reason that I have spent less of my free time watching TV and drinking wine this year, preferring instead to spend my time on more productive activities (like reading!)\nThe Very Nice Box by Laura Blackett and Eve Gleichman My favourite work of fiction this year was this sparkling debut novel that captured the zeitgeist in a manner that reminded me of Douglas Coupland novels in the early 1990s. Obsessive engineer Ada designs storage boxes for STÄDA, a furniture manufacturer that comes across as a cross between Ikea and a Silicon Valley big tech company.\nThis is a darkly humorous and suspenseful novel that is an easy read. Having bought and enjoyed it in the States around New Year prior to its UK release, I mailed my copy to my friend and erstwhile colleague Steph, as I knew she’d love it too. She soon messaged “I devoured it. I’m reeling. Thank you”.\nThe Best of the Rest A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence by Jeff Hawkins I bought this book after it was recommended by Bill Gates in one of his periodic Gates Notes emails. It is brimming with fascinating theories on how the human brain works – I was particularly taken by the explanation of “frames of reference” as a model for the way in which we comprehend the world.\nBewilderment by Richard Powers I don’t read many books which could be considered to fall within the category of science fiction. But Bewilderment doesn’t feel like traditional science fiction, rather it gently and sensitively covers broader themes of man’s impact on the earth, autism, our political systems, the loss of loved ones, and the workings of brain. This one will linger with me for a while.\nLearn How to Solve Cryptic Crosswords: A Course for Beginners by Henry Howarth When not reading books, I also enjoy reading newspapers and magazines_._ I usually skip straight past the cryptic crosswords in these, finding them to be baffling and impenetrable. B\nut one evening this year I lingered for a little while over a crossword in New Statesman and was pleasantly surprised to realise that I could work out the answer to one of the easier anagram clues.\nThis epiphany caused a curious tingle in my brain which I wanted to experience again. So I sought assistance via this excellent textbook-like work, which takes the reader on a step-by-step course explaining the different types of clues to be found in cryptic crosswords and techniques for solving these.\nThanks to this book, I now find myself capable of tackling the relatively easy Everyman crossword in The Observer each week, and sometimes the cryptic crossword in New Statesman, dependent on the setter. The tingles in my brain keep coming along with those “a-ha!” moments when the penny drops on a cute parsing. I’m enjoying building my vocabulary and general knowledge, and hope to build up to tackling the tougher problems in the national dailies next year.\nExponential: How Accelerating Technology is Leaving Us Behind and What to Do About It by Azeem Azhar This book considers the potential impact upon the world of technologies that are currently improving at an exponential rate. I found much of this far-sighted work to be reassuringly optimistic in nature, such as the potential for 3D printing to decentralise manufacturing bases, or the transition away from fossil fuels. Elsewhere however, Azhar highlights the inability of slowly-acting national governments to respond to a changing world with fast-moving social problems.\nSoftware Architecture: The Hard Parts. Modern Trade-Off Analyses for Distributed Architectures by Neal Ford, Mark Richards, Pramod Sadalage and Zhamak Dehghani This was my favourite technical book of the year. The weak joke about software architecture is that the answer to any question is “it depends”. As a result of this truism, most other books on the subject tend to give an overview of various nonfunctional considerations (scalability, deployability, testability, extensibility, etc) while stopping short of offering any firm guidance. After all, “it depends” on the specific system and business drivers.\n“The Hard Parts” faces head-on the complexities involved in making such trade-off decisions in the world of distributed systems in general and microservices in particular. Aided by an extended case study that runs throughout the book, it offers techniques to identify appropriate levels of reuse, decomposition, data ownership, distributed workflows, transactional sagas, and more. I particularly appreciated one of the later chapters on managing analytical data, which compared traditional Data Warehouses and Data Lakes with a more contemporary Data Mesh approach.\nIf It’s Smart, It’s Vulnerable by Mikko Hypponen Mikko Hypponen is a global cybersecurity expert with over thirty years’ experience working as a researcher and investigator. This short breezy book provides a fascinating array of anecdotes and insights from his career in infosec, in addition to concrete advice for how we as individuals can better protect ourselves in our increasingly interconnected world.\nNo One Round Here Reads Tolstoy: Memoirs of a Working-Class Reader by Mark Hodkinson It seems that since reading Lowborn and Poverty Safari, the Audible recommendation algorithm has concluded that I want to hear more tales of working class folk achieving against the odds. That’s how I discovered this charming and drily humorous autobiography by Lancastrian author, publicist and bibliophile Mark Hodkinson. In addition to the many anecdotes about reading and the publishing industry, this also features poignant yet often wildly funny chapters on music, schools, family relationships and terrible jobs.\nSeven Games: A Human History by Oliver Roeder The seven eponymous games covered in this book are checkers, chess, Go, backgammon, poker, Scrabble and bridge. For each, Roeder dives into the history, basic strategies, the personalities involved at the highest levels of the game, and what makes each game challenging for humans (and computers) to play. His first-hand reports of his experiences entering world poker and Scrabble competitions were particularly entertaining.\nI enjoyed studying Game theory at university in the mid-1990s where part of the course covered the basics of developing chess-playing software in a rather deterministic, brute-force manner. It was interesting to contrast those techniques with some of the modern AI/ML approaches described in this book that have been used to allow computers to succeed at these games.\nTrillions: How a Band of Wall Street Renegades Invented the Index Fund and Changed Finance Forever by Robin Wigglesworth My favourite financial book of the year, this history of index funds is a surprisingly mesmerising confluence of economics, history, mathematics, psychology, computer science and more. In addition to focusing on the cost savings that can be had to individuals who choose to invest via index funds rather than active managers, it also touches on the implications for corporate governance of the large proportion of companies now owned by “passive” funds.\nHope and Glory: A People’s History of Modern Britain by Stuart Maconie In this warm-hearted look at Britain, broadcaster and author Stuart Maconie selects one key event from each decade of the twentieth century, travelling to the location where they occurred and explaining how they have shaped the country in which we live.\nMaconie is an opinionated author, and in these divided times I suspect that levels of enjoyment of this book will depend upon whether your politics fall on the same side of the fence as his. Mine largely do, so I found this to be an entertaining, witty, and insightful read. Some of the scenes and interviews described from Maconie’s travels also made me consider that perhaps Britain (and England in particular) is after all a more welcoming, progressive and tolerant society than I had recently believed… but then I realised that this book was published back in 2012, just ahead of the unifying London olympics, and well before the divisive Brexit referendum.\nOut of Office: The Big Problem and Bigger Promise of Working From Home by Anne Helen Petersen and Charlie Warzel I have been fortunate enough to be able to work from home for the last 33 months, since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic made clients such as mine realise that this was a possibility.\nThis book explores the pros and cons of remote working, and in particular how to use the opportunity that this affords to change our lives and communities for the better. Some aspects of the discussion are rather US-centric in regard to the labour market and geography, but much of this commentary and analysis applies equally to our situation in the UK and Europe.\nReclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age by Sherry Turkle It is almost a quarter century since I first read a book by sociologist and clinical psychologist Sherry Turkle. Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet made a big impression on me as I was leaving university and stepping out into the world of work, helping me realise that the internet offered the ability to easily connect with people and ideas from far and wide.\nBy contrast, Reclaiming Conversation argues that we have now taken this search for broad but shallow connections too far, and have largely lost the capacity for the deeper one-to-one conversations that have the power to help us build meaningful lives and relationships. In a world of texts, tweets, and other micro-interactions, Turkle explores the benefits to education, business and family relationships that can be achieved by reclaiming the lost art of conversation.\nCatch-22 by Joseph Heller and A Clockwork Orange by Antony Burgess I have been making an attempt to supplement my predominantly contemporary reading diet with the occasional classic novel, and I especially enjoyed reading these two during 2022, in addition to The Catcher In The Rye and Of Mice and Men.\nCatch-22 had been recommended to me by my friend Jonathan Telfer when we were at university together in 1995, then again last year by colleague Magnus John when the character of Major Major somehow came up in conversation during a code review. I eventually succumbed to listening to the audiobook version narrated by Canadian actor Trevor White which is excellent – the dialogue in this funny and profound novel really benefits from being spoken aloud.\nI had bought a paperback of A Clockwork Orange in 1998 and not yet read it until this October. I think the prospect of tackling the Nadsat slang which is used in much of the narrative had dissuaded me from starting this book for so long, but in the event this proved little barrier to understanding and enjoying this short novel. The context in which the slang words were used aided comprehension, as did familiarity with the storyline from having seen Stanley Kubrick’s film adaptation.\nPrisoners of Geography: Ten Maps That Tell You Everything You Need to Know About Global Politics by Tim Marshall This illuminating book explains how each nation’s choices and geopolitics are shaped by coasts, rivers, mountains, deserts and plains. It concisely explains why international affairs are the way they are, and how the physical topography of the world has shaped the political world maps with which we are generally more familiar. With particular reference to recent events, it presciently explains the geographical context behind Putin’s war in Ukraine. There is a sequel, The Power of Geography, which I have bought but not yet read.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/the-20-books-i-most-enjoyed-reading-in-2022/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-top-5.wp-block-heading\"\u003eThe Top 5\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"stolen-focus-why-you-cant-pay-attention-by-johann-hari.wp-block-heading\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://amzn.to/3hZsGL5\"\u003eStolen Focus: Why You Can’t Pay Attention\u003c/a\u003e by Johann Hari\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy favourite book of the year \u003cem\u003epartially\u003c/em\u003e covers the same ground as previous favourites \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://amzn.to/3v0oxtC\"\u003eA World Without Email\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://amzn.to/3WgPFAm\"\u003eFour Thousand Weeks\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://amzn.to/3v07N60\"\u003eTen Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. But the scope of Hari’s work is much broader than these. Rather than merely telling us to stop doomscrolling Twitter and get on with life, he covers a multiplicity of factors and forces that are combining to steal the ability of many of us to focus. Social media, pollution, lack of sleep, poor diet, overwork and more are all discussed, with many pointers to third-party research.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The 20 Books I Most Enjoyed Reading in 2022"},{"content":"Yesterday morning I arose unusually early for a Saturday and drove eastwards to attend this year’s DDDNorth at the University of Hull. These free, community-driven events held at the weekend offer an invaluable opportunity to learn from peers in the industry in a relaxed environment.\nFive concurrent sessions in each timeslot means that tough decisions often have to be made about which to attend! In acknowledgement of my maturing years (I’ve been reading up on optimal stopping) and the niche that I have carved out for myself, I chose to stick to those sessions that focused on backend and distributed architecture and development.\nMy choice for the first session of the day was an overview of .NET Minimal APIs by Microsoft MVP Kevin Smith (@kev_bite). Restful APIs on the Microsoft .NET platform frequently form a key part of the systems that I design and develop, so it’s vital to stay abreast of the latest techniques for implementing these. Kev’s session was really useful to me as it concisely demonstrated the approaches available in .NET Core 7 Minimal APIs, freeing me of the need to discover what’s new via reading documentation or other means. I particularly appreciated seeing demonstrations of approaches for the automated testing of APIs, and some of the post-session Q\u0026amp;A about how best to structure real-world enterprise .NET APIs was insightful.\nKevin Smith demos how to test .NET Minimal APIs\nI’ve blogged before about the Inherent Negativity of Computer Programmers, and it’s fair to say that this pessimism hasn’t changed as my career has progressed! As an architect of distributed systems, knowledge of techniques for handling unavailable or poorly-performing dependencies are an essential part of my day-to-day toolset. Andy Clark’s (@techychap) entertaining session “When Microservices Go Bad” covered a variety of strategies such as caching, retries, timeouts, circuit breakers, bulkheads and rate limiting. For each of these, he showed how they can be achieved using the excellent open source library Polly. I’ve been using some of Polly’s features on my current project (I’ve been a long-time fan of Circuit Breaker since I first learned of it from reading Michael Nygard’s Release It! book), but this session opened my eyes to the full gamut of how Polly could help protect the systems I design. Hat-tip to Andy for the live demos in this session, and for contending with the multi-monitor weirdness.\nThe third session was my favourite of the day. “Don’t Put Your Messages In A Bottle: Implement Messaging Patterns” saw Azure Service Bus Senior Program Manager Eldert Grootenboer (@egrootenboer) provide a whistle-stop overview of fourteen (fourteen!) separate messaging patterns. The Circuit Breaker pattern made another appearance, as did some patterns which were new to me such as Sequential Convoy and Transactional Outbox. I’ve been getting by with simply using Azure Storage Queues for most of my queueing requirements in recent years, but this presentation reminded me of the richer techniques that are possible with Service Bus. This hour-long session flew by and left me wanting more. Time to dust off my copy of Hohpe and Woolf’s Enterprise Integration Patterns and brush up ahead of my next distributed architecture challenge.\n“Software Architecture: In Search of the Fourth Chord” by straight-speaking Paul Michaels (@paul_michaels) was a more laid-back session which covered many of the common problems and trade-offs faced by Software Architects. Paul rightly highlighted that the architect is likely the only person on a project who cares about the full range of functional and nonfunctional characteristics of a system. But I’m not sure that his throwaway comment “no-one ever says ‘can you make the system scale?\u0026rsquo;” is strictly true – I think this can depend on the project and sector. For example, a large part of my working life during the pandemic has involved ensuring that the NHS App and associated systems can scale to meet spikes in traffic, and here scalability and universal access are often of higher importance than, say, a richer feature set.\nThe session concluded by suggesting that, much as Status Quo have been able to have a successful musical career with a limited number of chords, so the average Software Architect can get a long way in their chosen career through judicious application of the Message Broker, Event Sourcing and CQRS patterns.\nThe final session I attended was “SOA Lessons Learnt (or, Microservices Done Better)“, where Sean Farmar (@farmar) gave an entertaining and often opinionated run through his experiences developing and architecting distributed systems since the 1990s. The general premise was that while technologies and fashions may change over the years, the key thing is to avoid coupling at all costs – a theme which I remember noting from my attendance at Software Architect 2007 fifteen years ago. It was also nice to be reminded of Peter Deutsch’s Fallacies of Distributed Computing, which are even more relevant today than they were in the mid-90s.\nFinally, before the dark and rainy drive home, it was time for goodbyes and the traditional prize draw. I’m delighted to report that I had the good fortune to win a GitHub-branded scarf which I shall wear with pride to protect my nesh self against the inclement Yorkshire winter that lies ahead.\nMany thanks to all who presented, organised and sponsored this year’s DDDNorth. As ever, it was an enjoyable and productive way to spend a Saturday.\nSporting my lovely new GitHub scarf\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/dddnorth-2022/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYesterday morning I arose unusually early for a Saturday and drove eastwards to attend this year’s \u003ca href=\"https://dddnorth.co.uk/\"\u003eDDDNorth\u003c/a\u003e at the University of Hull.

I heard you snoring though.”\nJuly 2013\nBen: “If you drop a piece of food on the floor for less than five seconds, you can still eat it.”\nMe: “Uh-huh. Where did you learn that?”\nBen: “At Beavers, when we were doing our ‘Healthy Eating’ badge.”\nAugust 2013\nBen: “Do you know, if there was no gravity, and all the dinosaurs went to a football pitch, the match would only last half a second.”\nSeptember 2013\nIsla: “Daddy, can I have a dot-to-dot picture of a princess?”\nMe: “Sure, here you go.”\nParenting must have been tougher before Google Images.\nOctober 2013\nBenjamin took his favourite book into school today to share with his class at “Show and Tell”.\nMe: “What did your class think of ‘The Odyssey’, Ben?”\nBen: “They thought it was epic!”\nOctober 2013\nMe: “Isla, what is your new dog called?”\nIsla: “Leash”\nNovember 2013\nMe: “Ben, your behavior today is not good for my blood pressure.

It’s Thursday!”\nBen: “Thursday is dead and I’m its bones.”\nMarch 2014\nOn a day trip to Bridlington beach:\nIsla: “Oh mummy, I like this rock with all the pretty colours!”\nJocelyn Nelson “Isla, that’s a lump of concrete..”\nApril 2014\nMe: “Good morning Isla”\nIsla: “Hi Daddy!

Which got me wondering – what are the best starter words to play in the opening lines at Wordle? I have been habitually using “ADIEU” as my starter word, reasoning that it contains a large number of vowels. But is D a particularly common consonant? And should I be trying to get O in there rather than the less frequently used U? I decided to do some computer-aided analysis to find the answer.\nSPOILER WARNING – this blog post contains information that may lead you to play more optimal Wordle starter words than you otherwise would have done if left to your own imagination. If you consider that this may take the fun out of an enjoyable daily practice, then I suggest that you stop reading. Now.\nPhoto by Ryoji Iwata / Unsplash\nDefinition Still here? OK, first a definition. What do I consider to be a good Wordle starter word? What makes one starter word better than another?\nI assert that the best Wordle starter words are those which are expected to result in the highest number of yellow (right letter, wrong spot) or green (right letter, right spot) tiles. Let’s call this E(Y|G). As a tie-breaker, where two words have the same value of E(Y|G), I consider the better word to be the one which is expected to result in the highest number of green tiles – let’s call this E(G).\nI’ve seen alternative approaches posted on Twitter that rank guesses in different ways, such as one which was based on how many possible answers from the Wordle corpus are excluded by guessing them. But my brain doesn’t work that way round – I don’t have the full list of Wordle words in my head to sieve through, and instead seek the positive reinforcement of yellow and green tiles to use as the basis for my later guesses.\nAssumption There are 12,972 valid words in the Wordle dictionary. For the purposes of this analysis, I’m going to assume that they all have an equal likelihood of being the Wordle answer on any given day. Clearly this is not true. I’ve only been playing Wordle for a couple of weeks but it’s immediately apparent that the winning words tend to be those in common everyday use. I doubt that the game would have its current levels of popularity were this not the case. My nine year old son loves playing Wordle every day, and this shared common bond is one of the things that makes Wordle so fun. There was quite some brouhaha on Twitter when the answer to Wordle 207 was the US English spelling of “FAVOR“, I can only imagine what an uproar there would be if the answer was ever something truly random like “QAJAQ“, “XYLYL” or “HYPHY“. But I digress. Whatever aspects of curation are taking place to select the daily Wordle, be it automated or human, I’m going to ignore it and assume that the Wordle is chosen randomly from the list of valid Wordle words.\nThe Top 10 Best Wordle Starter Words This is your last chance to look away. Having iterated through all 168,272,784 pairs of guessed word and answer, here are the ten best Wordle starter words\nTherefore, if you want to turn over the highest number of yellow and green tiles on your first Wordle play, and favour seeing the green tiles, then “AEROS” is your best bet. By comparison my previous favourite of “ADIEU” has an E(Y|G) of 1.49229 and E(G) of 0.32886.\nThe Best Words To Play Second But what comes next? What words are best to play on the second line? It depends how you like to play the game. If you’re like my mother, or have “hard mode” turned on, then your second and subsequent guesses will be influenced by the hints received in response to your first guess.\nOn the other hand, if you’re like me, at this early stage you’ll want to continue exploring the full breadth of the alphabet to increase the probability of identifying additional letters in the answer. For example I have generally been following up my “ADIEU” starter with “GHOST” to finish off the vowels and include T and S in the mix.\nWith this in mind, I extended my analysis to determine the combined E(Y|G) and E(G) values for pairs of valid Wordle words. All of the best results came from pairing together words that cover 10 distinct letters. Perhaps that seems intuitive, but it wasn’t a foregone conclusion. There are many guesses containing repeated letters which have excellent prospects, especially those with pairs of E or S. “EASER” is the best of these with an E(Y|G) of 1.68039, and pleasingly even “ARSES” weighs in with an E(Y|G) of 1.66489.\nHere are the ten best combinations of ten letters to cover with the first two guesses, with an example of two valid Wordle words covering those letters:\nBy comparison, my previous favoured pairing of “ADIEU” and “GHOST” has an E(Y|G) of 2.7358. Switching to a combination of words that covers the letters AEILNORSTU such as “AEROS” and “UNLIT” should boost my expected number of hints from my first two guesses by 12%!\nThe Best of the Best But which two words to pick? There are no fewer than 300 combinations of valid Wordle words which cover those best ten letters, all having a combined E(Y|G) of 3.06429. Again, I decided to use E(G) as a tie-breaker, which leads to the following ranking of pairs of starting words:\nAdieu, “ADIEU” So there you have it. Having crunched the numbers, my new pair of Wordle starter words from tomorrow morning shall be “TAILS” followed by “ROUEN“. Follow me on Twitter to see how it works out for me. I have a suspicion that despite this analysis, my mother will still reach the answer in fewer guesses than me more often than not!\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/the-best-wordle-starter-words/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLike (it would seem) most of the rest of humanity, the start of my 2022 has been immeasurably enhanced by starting each day playing \u003ca href=\"https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/\"\u003eJosh Wardle’s\u003c/a\u003e charming word game \u003ca href=\"https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/\"\u003eWordle\u003c/a\u003e.

I decided to do some computer-aided analysis to find the answer.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The Best Wordle Starter Words"},{"content":"The Top 5 {#the-top-5} And Away… by Bob Mortimer\nAs was the case in 2020, my favourite book of the year was an autobiography; this time by national treasure Bob Mortimer. Laugh out loud funny in many places, elsewhere this is tinged with melancholy and the realisation that, for all his on-screen tomfoolery, Mortimer is an incredibly shy individual.\nTouching, contemplative, warm and kind throughout, there is plenty of food for thought here regarding how we ought to live our lives and interact with those around us. I heartily recommend the audiobook, narrated by the great man himself.\nBoy Parts by Eliza Clark\nThis is a bit of a cheat, as I read this book in a couple of short days at the back end of 2020, in that weird downtime period between Christmas and New Year, at the recommendation of my good friend and erstwhile luncheon companion Stephanie.\nI haven’t read much fiction in recent years (only one novel made it on to last my annual round up last year) and tend to gravitate towards authors who are white male Boomers or Gen X. Eliza Clark made me realise what I had been missing – new generations of writers from different backgrounds with contemporary stories to entertain me.\nBoy Parts is a whirlwind ride – smart, funny, stylish and cinematic – that was genuinely unputdownable (except for the moments when I had to Google some unfamiliar terms, none of which I am going to repeat here). I’m grateful to this title for reawakening my interest in contemporary fiction and broadening my horizons, and hope that further novels from Eliza Clark will soon be forthcoming.\nBuilt on a Lie: The Rise and Fall of Neil Woodford and the Fate of Middle England’s Money by Owen Walker\nOne of the nice features of an Audible subscription is the ability to return any titles that you can’t get into. When I tapped the play icon at the start of this nine hour book about the collapse of Neil Woodford’s asset management company, I half-anticipated availing myself of that option shortly afterwards, as it had the potential to be quite dry and boring. But to my pleasant surprise, I found it to be one of the more gripping books that I listened to in 2021.\nThe journalistic style and chronological telling of a too-good-to-be-true business story gone bad reminded me of John Carreyou’s 2019 Bad Blood, about Elizabeth Holmes and the collapse of Theranos. I also felt that Walker’s clear and patient explanations of the inherent failings of the Woodford funds offered insights into risks to be aware of when managing my own (much smaller) personal investment portfolio.\nLuckenbooth by Jenni Fagan\nI loved the style and structure of this darkly gothic novel. Centred around an accursed Edinburgh tenement, it consists of nine intertwined stories covering different decades and different levels of the building. Stories within the storeys, if you will. This won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but I found it to be evocative, gritty and thoroughly entertaining.\nShould We Stay or Should We Go by Lionel Shriver\nThe married protagonists of this satire make a pact to commit suicide together aged 80. There follow many alternative scenarios wherein the couple do or don’t go through with this plan, and different political, economic, scientific and cultural situations arise. Some of these are all too believable, whilst others are stretched to the point of absurdity, as is to be expected from any good satire.\nA Brexit subplot and Covid backdrop gave this a contemporary spin, making it an easy pick for one of my books of 2021.\nThe Best of the Rest A World Without Email: Reimagining Work in the Age of Overload by Cal Newport\nOne of those books that you’d love your bosses or clients to read. Having worked wholly remotely since March 2020, and as part of a geo-distributed team for countless years before then, I find myself constantly plugged into what Newport accurately calls the “Hyperactive Hive Mind” approach to modern knowledge work. His argument is that real-time communication tools like Slack and Email serve to distract us and rob us of the opportunity to focus deeply and achieve truly meaningful productivity.\nSplit into two sections, this book first explores the case against such tooling, before secondly offering a series of principles and processes for how to rise above the noise and regain more structured and productive workflows. I read this book early in 2021 and appreciated greatly the valuable tactics and strategies it offers.\nCrossroads: In Search of the Moments that Changed Music by Mark Radcliffe\nThis summer I tried (and failed) for a second time to read Yeah Yeah Yeah – The Story of Modern Pop by St Etienne’s Bob Stanley. It seems like the kind of book that in theory I ought to like, but in practice I find it too comprehensive, worthy, and academic to be enjoyable. Perhaps I should skim through to the bits about the bands I care for.\nConversely, I found Crossroads: In Search of the Moments that Changed Music to be exactly the kind of music literature that floats my boat. It is packed with information, but delivers this with a fast-paced warm-hearted anecdotal style, much as you might expect from listening to Radcliffe speaking on the radio between records.\nFour Thousand Weeks: Time And How To Use It by Oliver Burkeman\nI have read very many traditional productivity books in my life. Getting Things Done, Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Get Everything Done and Still Have Time To Play, you know the kind of thing. This book isn’t one of those. It steps back from that hamster-on-a-wheel design for life, and instead suggests that you should embrace the limitation of a finite lifespan, choosing to recognise the impossibility of achieving everything and hence refocussing on what is genuinely worthwhile.\nHow Not To Be Wrong: The Art of Changing Your Mind by James O’Brien\nThe less arrogant and more contemplative sequel to How To Be Right, this sees O’Brien think again and encourage us to consider the reasons that we might hold the opinions that we do.\nHow to Make the World Add Up: Ten Rules for Thinking Differently About Numbers by Tim Harford\nMy favourite statistics book of the year! At a time when we are bombarded more than ever by information and misinformation of huge importance to our lives, this offers some essential advice for how to cut through the noise and our own biases and interpret statistics dispassionately.\nKlara and the Sun, and Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro\nI had been intending to read an Ishiguro novel for some time, so when his new novel Klara and the Sun was published in 2021, I took that as my cue to finally do so, and followed it shortly afterwards with Never Let Me Go.\nBoth novels had a superb pace and economical use of words that made the story flow effortlessly, pulling me along as if I were drifting around a lazy river on a rubber ring. The subject matter of both novels also touched on what it means to be human, which seems to be a recurring theme in my favoured reading material.\nLet Us Dream: The Path to a Better Future by Pope Francis\nNot my usual kind of read (being non-Catholic), but I felt drawn to this title during those long, dark, cold days of the third UK COVID lockdown at the start of 2021. Francis offered much comfort and hope at a bleak time, and also espoused visions and policies that struck me as being more enlightened and progressive than I had expected. Thoughtful, insightful, hopeful.\nLuster by Raven Leilani\nA debut novel about a Black woman in her twenties who gets involved with a forty-something white man in an open relationship. This was another of the young(-er than me) female writers that I felt compelled to read following my enjoyment of Boy Parts. The relationships described in the novel are complex and nuanced, in particular the protagonist’s relationship with her lover’s Black 12-year-old adoptive daughter.\nMilk Fed by Melissa Broder\nFood, sex, religion, and then some more food for good measure. The eating scenes in this novel about a Jewish lesbian with body dysmorphia felt like far guiltier pleasures than the sex scenes ever could be. A fascinating exploration of hunger, desire and faith.\nThe Rules of Living Well by Richard Templar\nI am a sucker for Richard Templar’s “Rules” series of books with their bite-sized advice on how to approach Life, Wealth, Work, Management, Love, and more. This “..Living Well” volume was published at an apposite time, when lockdowns and the covid pandemic have made many of us reconsider what is truly important in life and how to look after our mental and physical health.\nSmall Data: The Tiny Clues that Uncover Huge Trends by Martin Lindstrom\nThis book sat unopened on my Kindle for five years since I bought it in June 2016 before I read it on a sun lounger in a couple of days during the August of 2021. I shouldn’t have waited so long.\nLindstrom is a brand consultant who eschews Big Data and the soulless inferences it produces, in favour of more traditional anthropological research methods – talking to the natives in various target markets throughout the world to understand what really makes them tick. There are many interesting and insightful case studies included here, with chapter titles such as “Fanning Desire: How Siberian Refrigerator Doors and a Saudi Arabian Mall Created a Revolutionary Website for Russian Women” and “The United Colors of India: Selling Breakfast Cereals to Two Generations of Warring Women”.\nSoftware Engineering at Google: Lessons Learned from Programming Over Time curated by Titus Winters, Tom Manschreck and Hyrum Wright\nI figure that I’m allowed one tech book in my annual round-up, right?\nThis is an easy-going and varied collection of essays about how things are done at Google (mostly strictly technical things, but also softer things such as achieving a diverse workforce). As such, it offers useful insights for those of us who work on supposedly large-scale technical projects to judge ourselves against.\nOf course in truth, most of us will never work on systems with nearly so many users as Google, so it would be madness for us to, say, develop our own bespoke source control system or automated build tooling. But that doesn’t prevent this from being an interesting read. And some of the principles described, such as Hyrum’s Law, are well worth knowing.\nThis is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor by Adam Kay\nA highly engaging set of diaries from Kay’s time as a junior doctor in the NHS, this is one of the better “secret diary of…” books that seem to be en vogue in recent years. Very funny, frequently heartbreaking, and generally politically maddening, this book offered some eye-opening insights into the true nature of a very difficult career path.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/the-books-i-most-enjoyed-reading-in-2021/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-top-5-the-top-5\"\u003eThe Top 5 {#the-top-5}\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e \u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://amzn.to/3jwAUs6\"\u003eAnd Away…\u003c/a\u003e by Bob Mortimer\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs was the case in 2020, my favourite book of the year was an autobiography; this time by national treasure Bob Mortimer.

Good riddance. One might imagine that the enforced downtime offered by the pandemic lockdowns would have afforded me the opportunity to read many more books than I did in 2019.\nBut a displeasing proportion of my evenings in 2020 were spent relentlessly doomscrolling Twitter, eager for the latest morsels of information about the pandemic, US election or (sigh) Brexit. Besides, most of my “reading” in 2019 was actually achieved by listening to Audible while commuting or at the gym, two activities which barely featured in my life this year.\nStill, by year end it seems I have indeed read slightly more books (36) than I did last year (33), though on reviewing my list there are only a dozen that I feel compelled to tell you about:\nThe Top 5 {#the-top-5} The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons in Creative Leadership from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company by Robert Iger\nMy favourite book of the year is this autobiography by outgoing Disney CEO Bob Iger. One of Bill Gates’ regular book recommendations, I likely wouldn’t have considered reading it without his endorsement, as on the face of it this sounds like a typical airport business yawnfest. It’s not.\nRather than being about the dry, cold nature of business, earnings calls and margins, Iger’s book is full of warmth and humanity, with a particular focus on dealing with other people respectfully and understanding their motivations. This obvious genuine interest in other people allowed Iger to clinch stunning deals with Pixar, Lucasfilm, Marvel, and 20th Century Fox, whilst cultivating excellent relationships and friendships with the likes of Rupert Murdoch and Steve Jobs.\nAirhead: The Imperfect Art of Making News by Emily Maitlis\nExiting my office one afternoon in summer, I overheard Jocelyn listening to this audiobook, specifically a portion describing Maitlis’ memorable interview with short-lived White House Communications Director Anthony (“The Mooch”) Scaramucci. I knew instantly that I had to listen to the whole book without delay.\nIn addition to that memorable moment with The Mooch, Maitlis also relates tales of meetings with Donald Trump, Theresa May, Simon Cowell, Bill Clinton, James Comey, Tony Blair, Gordon Ramsay and many more. Russell Brand’s ruminations on the addictive properties of Penguin biscuits will live long in my memory.\nOn television Maitlis has always come across as a super-smart yet down-to-earth big sister figure, and this compilation of anecdotes from years of reporting the stories of the day and interviewing those who shape our world has a similar quality.\nSorry I’m Late, I Didn’t Want To Come: An Introvert’s Year of Living Dangerously by Jessica Pan\nAs a fellow introvert, I naturally found many of Pan’s tales of self-enforced extroversion butt-clenchingly cringy. But there’s no denying that they were also hugely entertaining and perhaps, just perhaps, also offer evidence that occasionally saying “yes” and getting oneself “out there” might lead to a more fulfilling life.\nDon’t get me wrong; I don’t plan to try stand up comedy or improv any time soon. But I might be open to the idea of making occasional smalltalk with my neighbours. Maybe.\nDo No Harm: Stories of Life, Death and Brain Surgery by Henry Marsh\nWhy would I, who as a child hated the very thought of injections, and as a teenager fainted on multiple occasions in biology lessons, possibly want to read a book about brain surgery, of all things?\nBut this was recommended to me by my erstwhile colleague, good friend and surprise cousin John Conners, whose opinion I respect, so I gave it a go.\nPleasingly, I discovered that Marsh’s memoirs were less about the “gory details” of his chosen vocation (though naturally the topic did crop up), and more about his interactions with patients and their families, existential questions of life and death, and his run-ins with all aspect of our wonderful, bureaucratic, horribly over-stretched NHS.\nThe Art of Statistics: Learning from Data by David Spiegelhalter\nFinally, an approachable book about statistics to take the baton from Darrell Huff’s 1954 classic How To Lie With Statistics.\nThe statistician that politicians love to quote has written a book that could easily become the canonical work for explaining the topic to the everyman. There is a surprising amount of warmth, opinion, and good humour between its pages.\nIf possible, get the hardback edition, or at the very least a physical copy. It is beautifully typeset and an object you’ll want to treasure.\nThe Best of the Rest Erebus: The Story of a Ship by Michael Palin\nIn discussing with friends and colleagues the books that we have read this year, I found it curious how frequently the question is broached of whether listening to audiobooks “doesn’t count” or is somehow “cheating”. I don’t think so – I think it is a perfectly reasonable way of efficiently consuming books, perhaps doing so at the same time as some other activity such as commuting, exercise, or other hobbies.\nThere’s also something quite primeval about stories being handed down by the oral tradition from our forebears. I listened to Erebus during my commutes in those innocent early pre-lockdown weeks of the year, and found it soothing and absorbing to listen to Palin’s familiar dulcit Sheffield tones tell me about this 19th Century ship and its crews’ tales of derring-do. While Spiegelhalter’s statistical tome is a book that naturally succeeds in hardcopy format, Erebus certainly excels as an audiobook.\nEverything Happens for a Reason and Other Lies I’ve Loved by Dr Kate Bowler\nBlimey. Kate Bowler is a student of Prosperity theology, the belief that financial blessing and physical well-being are the will of God for believers. The mother of a young son, Bowler’s world was shaken by a stage IV colon cancer diagnosis.\nThis elegant, grateful, thoughtful book describes Bowler’s experiences coming to terms with that diagnosis, the reaction of her church, and what is truly important in life. Lots of food for thought here.\nGhost In The Wires: My Adventures as the World’s Most Wanted Hacker by Kevin Mitnick\nRecommended to me by my techie colleague James Lavery, I expected that much of Mitnick’s book would be of a geeky nature, detailing the technical aspects of his exploits that led to his high-profile arrest and imprisonment for computer hacking. In fact, on listening to this book, it transpires that the most efficient technique at Mitnick’s disposal was not his technical skills but social engineering – the ability to convince other human\ns to reveal information that they should not have done.\nTime and again, in different states and in different ways, Mitnick used his self-confidence and relied on the natural goodwill of others to gain unlawful access to all manner of data and computer systems during the 1980s and 1990s. A thrilling ride.\nThe Life and Times of The Thunderbolt Kid: Travels Through My Childhood by Bill Bryson\nDuring 2020 I read (or re-read) six of Bill Bryson’s books. This was partly a reaction to the uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic. I appreciated hearing his light-hearted travel monologues – exploring the world in my mind while confined to our village.\nThis particular book, recommended by my colleague Mark D. Goldthorpe, takes the reader/listener back to Bryson’s childhood – midwestern America in the 1950s, a time of unparalleled happiness and bountifulness. A series of naïve early experiences relayed through the reflective prism of one well-travelled gentleman’s memory, it repeatedly brought a smile to my face during this difficult year.\nMachines Like Me by Ian McEwan\nThe only fiction book on my list this year. Set in an alternative history in the 1980s, this sees a version of the UK that loses the Falklands War, but in which technology is more advanced, and artificially intelligent androids are available to own.\nI found the storyline to be rather dark, yet captivating. It explores interesting philosophical questions, such as what it means to be human, and lingered long in my memory after I’d finished reading it.\nRebel Ideas: The Power of Diverse Thinking by Matthew Syed\nA huge range of case studies explaining the crucial benefits to be had from cognitive diversity – listening to a wide range of voices and opinions from different backgrounds – and the potential tragedies that can unfold when we limit ourselves to working within homogeneous groups.\nAs someone who has spent the majority of his career working on lone tasks – i.e. programming computers – but has in recent years broadened into more of a team lead role, I found some of these insights very helpful in my working life. They have persuaded me of the value of increasingly working together – pair-programming or mobbing – to pool cognitive diversity and solve complex problems more efficiently.\nWhy We Sleep: The New Science of Sleep and Dreams by Matthew Walker\nI found this somewhat dry, theoretical, and biological in nature in the earlier chapters. But as the book progressed and more applied examples were given it hammered home the wide-ranging benefits of getting a good night’s sleep.\nSince reading this I’ve been tracking the amount of time I spend asleep, and have been increasingly aware of the correlation between being suitably rested over an extended period, and my physical and cognitive wellbeing. I no longer labour under the delusion that time spent asleep is wasted time, or begrudge my teenaged son sleeping in at the weekends!\nConclusion Part-way through writing this blog post explaining why these books have appealed to me, I was surprised to note that there is an obvious theme running through many of these choice: People.\nMore than anything else in 2020, I have appreciated reading books which explore humanity, what it means to be human, and how to improve our interactions with other people:\nIger’s advice on how to treat others with respect for the advancement of business interests. Maitlis’s trying to understand what makes her interviewees tick. Pan’s attempts to be less introverted and increase her interactions with other people. Rebel Ideas explaining the devastating effects of failing to solicit a diverse range of opinions. The ease with which Kevin Mitnick repeatedly used social engineering techniques on other people who are predisposed to be helpful. Henry Marsh opening up skulls and operating on the incredible delicate brains that make us who we are. And even the sole fiction book on my list this year – Machines Like Me – is a fascinating exploration of what makes us human. I hope that as the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines progresses, 2021 will bring more opportunities for us all to resume our interactions with each other, and practice doing so in more thoughtful and respectful ways.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/12-books-i-most-enjoyed-reading-in-2020/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo that, then, was 2020.

Sadly, most of these queries are invariably of the “how do I print from my phone” or “the Sky box stopped working” ilk, and rarely trouble my software skills. So it came as a pleasant surprise when I recently encountered a genuine reason to use .NET, APIs and Docker in support of one of Jocelyn’s craft projects.\nJocelyn has embarked on crocheting a Temperature Blanket throughout 2020. This will consist of 366 squares, one for each day of this leap year, in colours corresponding to the minimum, maximum and average temperatures that we experienced on that day.\nAnd here was the rub – a notable absence of websites that provided these three daily data points for a location close to home. Some sites only had minimum and maximum, but no average. Others considered a “day” to run from, say, 4am to 4am, rather than midnight to midnight, which just isn’t in the spirit of the project. Still others offered the data points she needed, but not for any place close to home.\nI’m looking forward to some violet days\nHere was my opportunity to help and earn some husbandly brownie points! I already had an account for the excellent Dark Sky API, which offers forecast and historical weather data by latitude and longitude. Further, Adam Weiss has made available dark-sky-core, a .NET Standard Nuget Package for accessing this API from .NET code. I fired up Rider, started a new console app, bashed out the following quick function, and proudly presented the desired figures to Mrs Nelson.\nScope creep inevitably presented itself at this point, as a console application didn’t meet UX requirements.\n“That’s great Ian – now can you get it to email me the figures every day?”\nHmm. I didn’t want to get into that, but I could do one better, and make this into a simple self-service dedicated website. I launched a new Rider instance and created a boilerplate ASP.NET website to show the desired temperatures for the preceding 28 days. I added a standard Dockerfile, built and pushed a container image, and deployed it to an Azure App Service Plan. The final touch was to configure a memorable subdomain and so it was that http://blanket.iannelson.uk was born.\nThe (rough and ready) source code for both the console application and web version can be found on GitHub:\nPhotos of Jocelyn’s other colourful creations (and the occasional photobomb from our Miniature Schnauzer) can be found on her Instagram profile.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/temperature-blanket/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAs the resident geek in our family, it won’t surprise you to hear that I am occasionally approached by Jocelyn and our kids to provide tech support.

Good luck in your next role; keep in touch and we’ll see you around!”\n— Steve Hine, Lead Engineer, Financial Conduct Authority\n“Wishing you all the very best in your future endeavours, Ian Nelson. You’re far from the typical techy who simply completes a task and moves on. You’ve always gone above and beyond, keeping me in the loop with updates and making sure I was aware of any technical risks. Your thoughtfulness and proactive approach have meant a lot, and I’ll truly miss working with you. I have no doubt that your absence will be felt, and it will definitely have an impact on my work as well. Best of luck – you’ll be greatly missed.”\n— Shahnaaz Rahamatullah, Test Lead, Financial Conduct Authority\n“Thank you so much Ian Nelson, you were great to work with and a great guide in my first 6 months at FCA. You’ll be an asset in any future organisation you join. We’ll miss you big time.”\n— Alessio Bortone — Engineering Manager, Financial Conduct Authority\n“Wishing you all the very best for your future endeavours. May sound very formal but it is the truth — It was an ABSOLUTE PLEASURE working with you.. You helped me onboard quickly when I was new to the team and all backend stuff.. Always promptly replied to all my queries.. and I can go on… I hope our paths cross again in future”\n— Amruta Pawar — QA/Automation Test Engineer, Financial Conduct Authority\n“You’ve been simply awesome, and I truly mean that. You’ve made life so much easier for all of us; absolutely loved working with you – a true professional! FCA is lucky to have you looking after one of the most important parts of the software.”\n— Christophe Kalista – Solution Architect, Kainos\n“I just wanted to take note of what an asset Ian is to the NHS App team.\nHis well-roundedness as a Team Lead is impressive. He has both the technical knowledge and ability to apply it to ensure all components within the project have a good foundation. Ian has a superb eye for detail and is great at conveying how and why things should be implemented to the wider team, via code review, in stand-ups, and other technical discussions.\nIan is also a great team leader, particularly good at utilising individuals’ skills and juggling things around to make sure the team is both efficient, and more importantly that people are happy with what they are doing.\nOne of Ian’s greatest abilities is his patience. It is difficult working in a large team with a lot of different opinions coming from a lot of different angles. Policing these opinions to ensure things get delivered efficiently and to a high standard is a great challenge. I find Ian’s ability to stay calm under these scenarios impressive. He is able to approach problems with a cool head (no matter how sporadic or urgent the issue). He is able to mediate technical discussions and finds the right balance of listening to people’s opinions, while also being stern so that all team members are on the same page.\nLast of all, and probably most importantly, Ian cares a great deal. Both about the team (his cell and the wider team as well) and about delivering high-quality software for the user. This is extremely important when delivering for the public sector, in particular healthcare. It also makes Ian a pleasure to work with.\nIf I was to give Ian one piece of advice, it would be to possibly delegate more. Ian works long hours and one way to mitigate this would be getting other team members to pick up some of the tasks. I’m not saying that Ian doesn’t do this currently, but could apply it a little more.\nOverall Ian is someone Kainos is lucky to have, and I hope we continue to work together for as long as possible!”\n— Sean Devlin – Technical Architect, Kainos\n“I wanted to call out Ian Nelson for his excellent work on the NHS App. Ian has been fantastic to work with over the past six months. Of all the tech leads I found Ian to be the most approachable, often seeking technical advice from him, which really helped me settle into both my role and the project.\nIan really looks out for everyone on his team and does his utmost to ensure they are comfortable with their workload and aware of what is required from them on the project. He is excellent during stand-ups and in our planning sessions.\nA particular example I would like to single out was this past weekend. Ian contacted me to explain that a particular piece of work with the Cosmos DB had become more complex than we originally forecast, this work was on the critical path for the 1.0.0 cut-off and Ian thought the team may struggle to meet the deadline. My plan on the Monday before the cut-off was to see what we could arrange in regards to code freezes to make sure this work made it in. This wasn’t required however as Ian had gone above and beyone by working over the weekend, pulling together the team’s work and finalising it to ensure it was ready to go.\nIan is a consummate professional, a real asset to the project in my opinion and it has been a pleasure to work with him.”\n— Kevin O’Hara – Business Analyst, Kainos\n“I have worked with Ian for coming up to 2 years.\nIn that time we have worked on two projects – one of which we have partnered as joint senior developers. For this I was the front-end specialist and Ian was the back-end specialist and overall technical architect.\nI have been incredibly impressed with Ian’s ability to take on serious back-end challenges, sometimes with fairly minimal to no requirements and create an incredibly robust, highly-scalable enterprise-grade architecture.\nHis ability to work with the latest emerging technology stacks to deliver state-of-the-art services holds no parallel I have ever witnessed. Many times developers get used to a particular stack they are familiar with and stick with those tried-and-tested methods; but Ian’s ability to turn his hand to brand new technologies shows someone who is extremely adaptable with an incredible capacity to learn. I witnessed this first hand with his use of Azure which received Microsoft’s approval.\nIan can create architectures which are simple to follow with minimal architectural knowledge, yet powerful and dynamic enough to deal with pretty much any situation. This has been crucial in our relatively small team where in just 6 month we were loading real customers onto our system and have continually been adding features to support over 1,000 clients. In addition, being a small team Ian has had to speak and present to every level of the business and also deal with third-party providers and partners – and has done so with the highest grade of professionalism which has earned him the respect of his colleagues.\nI can confidently say I am a better developer because I have worked alongside him, and between us we have created some state-of-the-art services which are well-respected within the PR industry. I would relish the opportunity to work alongside him again.”\n— James West – Freelance Software Developer, Access Intelligence Plc\n“Ian is one of the most hard-working and professional individuals that I have had the pleasure to work with. His methodical approach allows him to digest the problem put before him prior to making a reasoned and rational suggestion. Ian’s development skills and knowledge were able to cope with every challenge, identifying one or more solutions for every scenario that I put forward as Product Owner. This allowed me to then pick the best solution for the project.\nIan is a consummate team player and worked efficiently and effectively with the other members of the development team. He always made himself available for me to ask questions to help me understand the technical aspects of a story.\nIan’s expertise and problem-solving skills have helped to drive the project forward and I am extremely grateful for the contribution that he has made. He will be greatly missed, not just by me, but by the whole of the team. I wish him the best of luck with any future projects he undertakes and I hope to be able to work with him again in the future.”\n— Robin Hackshall – Senior Information Analyst, Health and Social Care Information Centre\n“Ian has enabled us to drive some major changes into the business whilst introducing new technologies and concepts to the team. We now have great working examples of Workflow, NHibernate, IoC, programming to interfaces and MVC code which can be applied in other applications. I couldn’t have asked for more – a combination of business and technological advancement. Thanks again.”\n— Sion Harrison – Development Manager, Marshalls Plc\n“Ian worked on a particularly troublesome project for me for eight months at NHS Choices without complaint. His development skills and knowledge are exemplary and his NHibernate knowledge is second to none. He worked well with all the members of the team and helped me to introduce pair programming and push the test driven development agenda. I will employ Ian whenever I have the chance.”\n— Nick Porthouse – Development Manager, NHS Choices\n“I was fortunate enough to work with Ian on a relatively complex distributed, ReSTful system for the NHS IC.\nIan is an exceptional software developer, who produces well thought through, clean and tested code adhering strongly to SOLID principles.\nHis knowledge of OO design principles, architectural patterns and his ability to reduce friction in a multi developer environment has an extremely positive effect on both the\nsystems he works on and the people he works with. Coupled with his expertise in data modelling and access patterns, you can be sure your project is in safe hands.\nI have absolutely no hesitation in recommending Ian.”\n— Paul Campbell – Freelance Software Developer and Service Architect, Health and Social Care Information Centre\n“I had the pleasure of collaborating with Ian on a large scale survey data gathering and processing solution, incorporating distributed components developed using C# and SSIS.\nIan was able to take high-level business requirements and swiftly design and produce a set of solid, scalable, and efficient systems, and with meticulous attention to detail.\nIan’s grasp of agile tools, design patterns, and NHibernate in particular are masterful, and I would recommend him without hesitation.”\n— Ashfaq Hussain – Freelance Application Developer, Health and Social Care Information Centre\n“Ian proved to be a fantastic choice; as well as being one of the most technically adept developers I’ve ever worked with he’s good company and delivers high-quality code in small amounts of time. All-in-all a very good hire, and I hope I have the good fortune to work with him again.”\n— Joe Steele – Technical Team Leader, Ventura\n“I worked with Ian for nearly 3 years in NHS Digital. Ian is dependable, forward-thinking, and quite possibly the most level-headed person I’ve come across!”\n— Jack Morris — Platform Architect, Kainos\n“Ian is one of the most intelligent and diligent people I’ve ever worked with. When Ian is involved, I know everything is going to be ok :)”\n— Ciaran Colgan — Freelance .Net Architect, Developer\n“Ian, maybe you know what you are talking about.”\n— Roman Podkovyrin, Senior Software Developer, Kainos\n“Spending 2 years working with Ian was a pleasure. He’s a consummate professional, a highly talented developer, a great problem solver and a real team player. I learned a lot working with him, found him great to bounce ideas off and would be delighted to work with him again. Definitely top class.”\n— John Conners – Senior Software Developer, Marshalls Plc\n“I saw your post on DDDNorth which made me even more gutted that I couldn’t make it! I wanted to let you know that working with you at Piksel opened my eyes on how a professional developer should be. I still use NCrunch daily from your recommendation and I try to pay it forward by recommending it in the same way.”\n— TG – Contract .NET Developer\n“Ian, many thanks for your contribution to the Halifax project for the last 2 years plus. You showed a great deal of patience in a difficult climate and managed to create a very good impression with the Halifax people you worked with.”\n— Robin H Scholz – Keane Limited\n“Ian is certainly one of the smartest and most productive developers that I have had the pleasure of working with. His knowledge of existing and emerging technologies and trends, coupled with a keen sense of where they can be best utilised within a business environment ensures that the applications he produces are fully fit for purpose and are easy to maintain.\nDuring his time at Marshalls, Ian produced several high-profile business critical applications that continue to function effectively day-in day-out. I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending Ian for any software development position and hope that I get to work with him again some day.”\n— Colin Lowe – Development Team Leader, Marshalls Plc\n“You’re good at solving problems, Daddy.”\n— Ben Nelson (aged 4)\n“Impressed how quickly you’ve done this.

This opens up the possibility of running all kinds of applications on the NAS, turning them into home servers with boundless possibilities.\nOne of things I wanted to run on my own Synology NAS is RabbitMQ, the popular open-source message broker. I intend to use this as the heart of a distributed home climate measuring project, with a bunch of low-cost Raspberry Pi devices sending regular sensor readings to a database, or directly to a real-time web application.\nHere’s how to go about installing RabbitMQ on a Synology NAS, as of January 2020. The whole process should only take around 15-30 minutes at most.\nFirst, open up Package Center and search for the free Third-Party Docker package. If it’s not already installed, go ahead and Install it, otherwise Open it.\nWithin the Docker package, we need to search the Registry for the rabbitmq image. Look for the image with the “Official Image” icon next to it, which should be near the top of the search results.\nChoose a tag to install. I recommend selecting a recent build with the “management” suffix – these tags have the RabbitMQ management plugin installed and enabled by default, which is available on the standard management port of 15672.\nAfter the Docker image has downloaded to the NAS, select it from the list of images on the Image tab, and click Launch to create a new container from that image.\nGive the new container a suitable name (rabbitmq seems the obvious choice), and then click the Advanced settings button.\nCheck Enable auto-restart so that the container automatically restarts, should it stop for any reason.\nContainers should generally be treated as being replaceable, with any data that you care about being kept outside of the container. To this end, create a folder on the NAS that can be used as a volume for the /var/lib/rabbitmq mount path. This ensures all the data from the RabbitMQ instance exists outside of the container itself and won’t be lost if the container needs to be destroyed and recreated for any reason (such as upgrading to a new version of RabbitMQ).\nI also suggest creating a blank RabbitMQ config file – rabbitmq.conf – and mounting this file to the path /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf .\nRabbitMQ with the management plugin enabled uses ports 4369, 5671, 5672, 15671, 15672 and 25672. There’s a low probability of these ports already being in use by other applications on the NAS, so map those container ports to the same local ports.\nCheck the Environment variables tab. The defaults should be fine; you may wish to specify a particular node name – this can be done using the RABBITMQ_NODENAME environment variable\nThat’s it. Click Apply, and Apply again on the Summary screen.\nThe RabbitMQ docker container will start, and if everything has gone to plan, it should stay running and not restart. To check out the logs, select the container from the Container tab and click the Details button.\nFrom the details, click the Log tab. If startup has been successful, you will the “Server startup complete; 3 plugins started.” message as shown below. Otherwise, these logs should give a useful indication what has gone wrong.\nThe RabbitMQ mnesia folder will be initialized in the folder specified earlier as a mapped volume.\nThe RabbitMQ Management portal will be accessible through a web browser at port 15672 on your NAS’s hostname or IP address. But if you try to login using the default guest/guest credentials you will likely be met with the “User can only log in via localhost” message shown below. That’s not an option from the Synology NAS, which doesn’t have any web browser installed.\nThere are a couple of solutions to this quandary. The rabbitmq.conf file created earlier could be edited to allow the guest user to connect from a remote host by setting the loopback_users configuration to none – details here.\nAlternatively, the rabbitmqctl utility can be used to add a new user with administrator rights, as shown in the screenshot below.\nHaving done this, it will be possible to login to the RabbitMQ management console from a remote machine using the newly-created credentials.\nBoom! There we have it. RabbitMQ running in a Docker image, on a Synology NAS, with the management plugin accessible from the local network.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/how-to-install-rabbitmq-server-in-docker-on-a-synology-nas/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOne of the game-changing features of \u003ca href=\"https://www.synology.com\"\u003eSynology\u003c/a\u003e‘s NAS (Network-Attached Storage) devices is their ability to run \u003ca href=\"https://www.docker.com/\"\u003eDocker\u003c/a\u003e, the industry-standard containerization technology.

I was both amazed and ashamed that a leader of a nation could consume so much literature whilst I, a mere sellsword codemonkey, barely got through a book every month (or two).\nIt wasn’t that I didn’t enjoy reading – I have always loved reading (and buying) books – it was just that I had somehow convinced myself that I didn’t have the time to read. I realised that this simply wasn’t true, that I could easily make time to read if I so desired, and vowed to consume more books during 2019.\nPleasingly, I’ve been quite successful in my endeavours. Audible has helped greatly, turning otherwise dead time spent commuting, walking the dog, mowing the lawn, or working out at the gym into productive book consumption time.\nHere are the twenty books that I’ve most enjoyed during the year:\nThe Top 5 {#the-top-5} Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World by Cal Newport\nThe only book that I read cover-to-cover on two separate occasions during 2019. Following on from So Good They Can’t Ignore You and Deep Work, two other favourites of mine, Cal’s latest book offers practical concrete advice on how to regain focus in these digitally-distracted times.\nTalking to Strangers: What We Should Know about the People We Don’t Know by Malcolm Gladwell\nA wonderful book that opened my eyes to how I engage and interact with other humans, and the many potential opportunities for devastating misunderstandings. I recommend the enhanced audiobook highly, as (where possible) it features original audio recordings and interviews with people involved in the case studies.\nBad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup by John Carreyrou\nI had never heard of Theranos nor Elizabeth Holmes before reading this gripping true-life tale of organisational deception and misbehaviour, written by the WSJ investigative journalist who broke the story.\nHow to Be Right: … in a world gone wrong by James O’Brien\nA great book written from the relatively unusual vantage point of talk radio host James O’Brien, who spends his days calmly and rationally explaining to callers the absurdity of their stated viewpoints (often, it seems, by simply giving them sufficient opportunity to explain themselves, or consider the meaning of the cliched words that they spout). Despite the title, O’Brien doesn’t claim to always be right, and in some chapters explains how the discourse on his show has led to the maturation of his own viewpoints.\nCoders: Who They Are, What They Think And How They Are Changing Our World by Clive Thompson\nA bit of navel-gazing really, I enjoyed reading Wired Magazine’s Clive Thompson’s masterful description of what coders are like, and why. The audiobook is over 13 hours, but it flew by for me in little over a week’s listening. We coders are a funny (and disturbingly homogenous) breed, and this timely work explains us perfectly.\nThe Best of the Rest Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones by James Clear\nIt’s the little things, you know? I read this book in the first half of the year, and its advice was instrumental in helping me (as the subtitle clearly says) to break some terrible habits and form some wonderful new ones (like reading more books!). I think it’s high time I flicked through this modern classic again, as I set new goals for 2020.\nThe Behavioral Investor by Daniel Crosby\nI read a surprising number of books about investing, most of which are too humdrum to mention here. But The Behavioral Investor is a brilliant, comprehensive explication of the psychological and physiological impediments on successful investing, along with tactics and strategies to overcome these.\nThe Body by Bill Bryson\nAs someone who dislikes the thought of blood and dropped the study of Biology at the first opportunity aged 14, I’m amazed that I made it through this book. In the interests of road safety I did postpone listening to a couple of chapters whilst driving. As with most Bryson books, there is an engaging mix of science, history and human interest anecdotes to avoid the topics ever becoming too dry.\nThe Creativity Code by Marcus du Sautoy\nI read a few different popular books on AI, Machine Learning and Algorithms in 2019. This was my favourite, as it delved down to (for me) the right levels of mathematical and computational detail without being either facile nor bewildering.\nEssentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg McKeown\nA relatively short book that, in places, inevitably covers some of the same ground as Atomic Habits, Digital Minimalism and Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now. But nonetheless, it’s a decent high-level overview of how to do less yet accomplish more (or rather, more of the right things). I’ll most likely reread this at some point in 2020.\nFifty Things That Made the Modern Economy by Tim Harford\nA lovely easy book to dip into. Fifty bite-sized micro-documentaries explaining how the modern economy as we know it was formed. I listened to much of this while decorating my study and mowing the lawn. I fear it may have resulted in my becoming a tedious bore (“Did you know…?”) in conversations with Mrs Nelson for weeks afterwards.\nGotta Get Theroux This: My Life and Strange Times in Television by Louis Theroux\nOne of the few biographical books I read during the year, from national treasure and documentary maker Louis Theroux. I was in need of something lighter after wading through Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, and Jocelyn wisely suggested I read this. Entertaining, yet more than a little poignant in many places, most obviously in the chapters on Jimmy Savile.\nHidden Figures: The Untold Story of the African American Women Who Helped Win the Space Race by Margot Lee Shetterley\nNot remotely techie or geeky, this is a fascinating social history of how a group of brilliant women helped the US Space Program to succeed, despite facing twin prejudices due to their gender and the colour of their skin. Some of these themes also crop up in Coders, one of my other favourites from 2019\n.\nInvisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men by Caroline Criado Perez\nGuaranteed to make every feminist’s piss boil, and rightly so. Superbly researched book exposing shocking gaps in datasets as far as women’s requirements are concerned.\nThe Only Story by Julian Barnes\nI don’t often read novels about love, but when I do they are usually written by Julian Barnes.\nPoverty Safari: Understanding the Anger of Britain’s Underclass by Darren McGarvey\nI chanced upon this book in Waterstones while on a weekend city break to Glasgow for August Bank Holiday. Unexpectedly hilarious, well-paced and thought-provoking. Quite insightful reading for middle-class pricks like me.\nReady Player One by Ernest Cline\nNot the kind of thing I would usually buy, but the Wil Wheaton narrated audiobook was recommended to me by Nick McKenna, so I gave it a go and thoroughly enjoyed it. Filled with much 1980s nerdy nostalgia which warmed the cockles of my heart. Subsequently made into a moving picture directed by one Steven Spielberg, apparently.\nTen Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now by Jaron Lanier\nEloquent, well-argued, and coming from a very smart Silicon Valley pioneer like Lanier, these ten arguments are difficult to ignore. Combined with Essentialism and Digital Minimalism, this helped to persuade me to spend more time engaging in meaningful activities and less time frittering my life away on social media in 2019.\nWho Owns England?: How We Lost Our Green and Pleasant Land, and How to Take it Back by Guy Shrubsole\nA bit of a wildcard, but this book featured a combination of statistics, history, cartography and lefty politics that I couldn’t resist.\nWhy We Get The Wrong Politicians by Isabel Hardman\nThe system’s fucked. But then, you probably guessed that. Hardman goes into much more detail, which you will either appreciate (like me) or find tedious (like Mrs Nelson, who heard several chapters of this book by proxy when we were decorating the living room).\nWhat’s Next? You’ve seen the kind of things I enjoyed reading in 2019; what should I read in 2020?

Not this time in the company of my university friends, but instead with a ten-year-old boy in tow, namely my eldest Son, Benjamin. It was half-term holiday, he had just finished SATs, and I was hoping to prise him away from screens for a few days and to pass on some of my latent enthusiasm for the Highlands.\nThe journey took longer than I expected. We departed home around 1030 and reached Killin by 1700. Google helped us avoid two traffic jams, a technology that hadn’t existed on my earliest Scottish trips in 1998 (nor, for that matter, did the A74(M)’s parenthetical M). We were staying at the Bridge of Lochay Hotel, and after a pleasant evening meal there we took a drive down the road between Ben Lawers and the Bridge of Balgie, where we saw a bewildering number of wild campers.\nBack at the hotel, we got Scrabble out. Showing no mercy against my opponent’s tender years, I played all seven tiles on one round to spell ALBUMEN and turn EATING into BEATING, scoring 75 points.\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/IMG_20180526_143147.jpg\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_IMG_20180526_143147.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_IMG_20180526_143147.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/3_IMG_20180526_143147.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/4_IMG_20180526_143147.jpg 2400w\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;2000\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;2667\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/IMG_20180526_205848_341.jpg\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_IMG_20180526_205848_341.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_IMG_20180526_205848_341.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/3_IMG_20180526_205848_341.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/4_IMG_20180526_205848_341.jpg 2400w\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;2000\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;2000\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Day Two – Sunday, 27th May 2018 I was cognisant that if I was to make the trip a success and a happy memory for Ben (and thus encourage him to want to return), there was no point dragging him up some featureless 3,000-footers. Instead I had planned a whistle-stop tour of the Highlands’ best views, with some fun touristy activities thrown in for good measure.\nThe first of these activities was a trip to Go Ape at Aberfoyle, which culminated with a stunning 45-metre-high, 426-metre-long zipwire flight followed by a bottle of Irn Bru.\nRefreshed, we headed up the nearby Ben A’an, at 454m one of the most popular and picturesque wee hills in Scotland. The weather was unseasonably fine, and we were offered glorious views across the Trossachs.\nWe left Ben A’an car park around 1700. Ben dozed off in the car, and we reached our accommodation at the legendary Clachaig Inn by 1840. By this late hour and following our earlier exertions Ben was super tired and hangry – reluctant to eat but perked up noticeably after having done so. I realised that a quieter day was probably in order for the following day.\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/00000PORTRAIT_00000_BURST20180527154957149.jpg\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_00000PORTRAIT_00000_BURST20180527154957149.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_00000PORTRAIT_00000_BURST20180527154957149.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/3_00000PORTRAIT_00000_BURST20180527154957149.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/4_00000PORTRAIT_00000_BURST20180527154957149.jpg 2400w\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;2000\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;1500\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/IMG_20180527_174915.jpg\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_IMG_20180527_174915.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_IMG_20180527_174915.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/3_IMG_20180527_174915.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/4_IMG_20180527_174915.jpg 2400w\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;2000\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;2667\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Day Three – Monday, 28th May 2018 A quieter day than Sunday. Initially Ben was adamant that he wanted to do more walk\ning (Ben A’an having whet his appetite for views), so we intended to wander up the Lost Valley of Glencoe. But upon reaching the car park, he declared that he did not feel well enough for a hike – something that has happened to me on more than one occasion! So instead we went up the nearby Nevis Range Mountain Gondola on the north face of Aonach Mor. The sun was beaming down again, a far cry from the whiteout conditions that I had experienced on 25th November 2000 when my friends and I had to abandon an attempt to reach the Aonach Mor summit from nearby Aonach Beag.\nBack down to the car, and with Ben still not in the mood for activity, we took a long drive around Ardnamurchan – Glenuig, Strontian (location of the discovery of Strontium, as I boringly explained to Ben in typical Dad fashion), and back via the Corran Ferry. I resisted the small temptation to take a short but lengthy detour down the narrow tracks to Ardnamurchan Point, having fallen into that trap on a previous jaunt at August Bank Holiday 2002. Despite this, the relative lack of civilisation for miles around was not lost on us as we struggled to find a convenient place to stop for a bite of lunch. I vowed to learn this lesson on subsequent days, stocking up the car with sandwiches and snacks at the start of the day rather than risk a hungry and grumpy pre-teen companion.\nIn the evening we sat outside the Clachaig playing chess. We heard tell of a couple of other tourists who had required medical attention after being up on a ridge with too little water and no sunhats. After this it was easier on subsequent days to persuade Ben to wear his own sunhat.\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/IMG_20180528_123222.jpg\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_IMG_20180528_123222.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_IMG_20180528_123222.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/3_IMG_20180528_123222.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/4_IMG_20180528_123222.jpg 2400w\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;2000\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;1500\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/IMG_20180528_202950.jpg\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_IMG_20180528_202950.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_IMG_20180528_202950.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/3_IMG_20180528_202950.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/4_IMG_20180528_202950.jpg 2400w\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;2000\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;1500\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Day Four – Tuesday, 29th May 2018 A lot of driving, unfortunately. I had forgotten how long it can take to get from A to B in the Highlands sometimes. After stopping in Fort William for sandwiches and a pack of playing cards we headed for the picture postcard Eilean Donan Castle. Here the increasing popularity (and potential Disneyfication) of the Highlands began to hit me. I have photographs from 2002 wherein my friends and I were the only visitors to an otherwise deserted EDC. No longer – extended car and coach parks and additional visitor infrastructure were now in place to accommodate the hoards of tourists.\nWe enjoyed an ice cream each in the stifling heat before driving up to Plockton, passing the alarming sight of a wildfire in its early stages en route. We later learned that an electrical transformer had exploded, igniting part of the tinder-dry Strathellen Wood. After a quick drink in The Plockton Hotel we boarded the legendary Calum’s Seal Trip, without which no trip to the north west would be complete. Apart from ourselves, the boat was filled with Italian tourists, who laughed politely at Calum’s gags, which have not changed at all in the last twenty years. One of the staff explained to me that Scotland has become more popular than ever with foreign visitors in recent years, and attempted to convince those same foreign guests that the inexplicably brilliant 2018 weather was typical for the location and time of year.\nWe stayed at a very pleasant and peaceful AirBnB by the name of Fasgro in Drumbuie. Our host, Carol, recommended an evening coastal walk, which turned out to be one of my highlights of the entire trip.\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/IMG_9782.jpg\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_IMG_9782.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_IMG_9782.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/3_IMG_9782.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/4_IMG_9782.jpg 2400w\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;2000\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;1333\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/IMG_9812.jpg\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_IMG_9812.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_IMG_9812.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/3_IMG_9812.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/4_IMG_9812.jpg 2400w\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;2000\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;1333\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/IMG_20180529_151250.jpg\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_IMG_20180529_151250.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_IMG_20180529_151250.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/3_IMG_20180529_151250.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/4_IMG_20180529_151250.jpg 2400w\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;2000\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;1500\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2020-01-14_20-37-02.png\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_2020-01-14_20-37-02.png 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_2020-01-14_20-37-02.png 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2020-01-14_20-37-02.png 1371w\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;1371\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;1339\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Day Five – Wednesday, 30th May 2018 We left Drumbuie, passed through Lochcarron, and headed up the Bealach na Ba pass, which was a much easier drive in the summer months than winter snows. For one thing there were no angry van drivers to wind their windows down as we passed and inexplicably yell at me for being a “bloody fool”. Scottish hospitality has definitely improved.\nAfter parking up, we took advantage of our high altitude to wander up to the transmitter station, then over to the 792m Corbett Sgurr a’ Chaorachain. I thought this was an easy walk with cracking views over to Skye and Raasay. But Ben was hard work, complaining every step of the way and having to be bribed to continue (I placed Amazon orders for new XBox games from the Corbett summit!). I was unsure why he disliked this walk compared to the steeper exertions of Ben A’an earlier in the week.\nBack to the car, and we drove through the majestic Torridon, Kinlochewe (stopped for another ice cream), and on to the Aultguish Inn. There has clearly been some capital investment here, as the room facilities had improved immeasurably since my visits in the earliest years of the century.\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/COLOR_POP.jpg\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_COLOR_POP.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_COLOR_POP.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/3_COLOR_POP.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/4_COLOR_POP.jpg 2400w\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;2000\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;1500\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/IMG_20180530_120619.jpg\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_IMG_20180530_120619.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_IMG_20180530_120619.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/3_IMG_20180530_120619.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/4_IMG_20180530_120619.jpg 2400w\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;2000\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;1500\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2020-01-14_20-39-22.png\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_2020-01-14_20-39-22.png 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_2020-01-14_20-39-22.png 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/3_2020-01-14_20-39-22.png 1600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2020-01-14_20-39-22.png 2188w\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;2000\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;1344\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Day Six – Thursday, 31st May 2018 Ben was sick in the night, explaining his lack of enthusiasm on the hills the previous day. We abandoned plans to scramble up Stac Pollaidh, and instead opted for more driving – a big circular route around the far north. We saw Durness, Tongue, and some wonderful coastal scenes along the A836 across the very top of the country, before reaching the anticlimactic John O’Groats where we bought some soft toys and sweets as gifts for Ben’s siblings. Our journey back down the eastern seaboard was shrouded in thick fog, depriving us of any seascape views.\nIn the evening we played card games in the hotel bar, by which time Ben was on much better form, thrashing my exhausted self at most games and feeling well enough to devour the biggest dessert on the menu.\nAfter Ben retired to our room to watch some TV talent show, I got chatting to a pleasant young bohemian lady, who had recently embarked on an attempted continuous round of the Munros, travelling between them on bicycle. I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t slightly envious of her freedom and ability to take so much time out of the rat race for such an endeavour. But conversely, I was happy to have had a Son in tow with whom to share a brief week experiencing some of the many delights that Scotland has to offer to all ages.\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot_20180601-212905-1.png\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;1080\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;1920\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/IMG_20180531_135735.jpg\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_IMG_20180531_135735.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_IMG_20180531_135735.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/3_IMG_20180531_135735.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/4_IMG_20180531_135735.jpg 2400w\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;2000\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;2667\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;aligncenter\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/IMG_20180531_200439.jpg\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_IMG_20180531_200439.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_IMG_20180531_200439.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/3_IMG_20180531_200439.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/4_IMG_20180531_200439.jpg 2400w\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;2000\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;2667\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/scotland-with-a-son/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"day-one-saturday-26th-may-2018\"\u003eDay One – Saturday 26th May 2018\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty years after bagging my first Munro – the dreary \u003ca href=\"https://blog.iannelson.uk/meall-a-chrasgaidh/\"\u003eMeall a’ Chrasgaidh\u003c/a\u003e – and somehow developing an affinity for the Great Scottish Outdoors, I found myself heading northwards once again.

Not that I’d be looking for an excuse – these free events are always superbly organised and provide a valuable opportunity to see sessions from a wide range of speakers without having to take time off work. It’s no wonder the tickets are always snapped up so quickly.\nAs a contractor, I also appreciate the opportunity that DDDNorth affords me to catch up with so many friends and colleagues that I’ve worked with over the years, and it was great to see so many familiar faces.\nWith five slots during the day each offering five concurrent sessions there were plenty of difficult choices to be made. In general, I tried to attend sessions offering information I didn’t think I would be able to get from books, blogs or PluralSight – stories from the trenches and architectural concepts rather than deep dives on specific technologies.\nThe first session I attended was “So You Want To Be A Tech Lead – 10 Things You Need To Do To Succeed” by Joel Hammond-Turner (@rammesses). I was delighted to find that the eponymous ten things were not airy-fairy woolly soft-skill type things, but in fact consisted of ten topics backed by a whole bunch of concrete real-world actionable suggestions. These ranged from large architectural tasks (use NuGet obsessively for all internal dependencies, set up automated release management with Octopus, etc) to the little things that can make a difference (be willing to take your headphones off, read and share The Morning Brew, add photographs to Personas..)\nNext I saw “Not Just Layers! What Can Pipelines and Events Do For You?“, presented by DDD circuit regular Ian Cooper (@icooper). This was the most technical session that I saw, and required some serious concentration. Ian started his presentation with some slides that explained the theoretical background behind the architectural concepts he was introducing. These were beautiful and densely packed with information, and I plan to review them at my leisure! He then fired up Visual Studio and demonstrated some C# implementations of the patterns previously described. Kudos to Ian for creating a successful presentation on a fairly dry architectural topic – inevitably it could only scratch the surface but has whetted my appetite to venture beyond the typical layering approach when considering candidate software architectures.\nAs I hurtle inexorably towards my 40s, and noting the general absence of older coders in the workplace, I have been starting to wonder whether I need to identify alternative career paths away from the code face. So the following talk was of particular interest to me.\nCeri Shaw’s (@cerishaw) talk “Join The Dark Side – Why Developers Should Consider Management” began by covering some of the negative managerial stereotypes that we techies tend to hold (yes, there was a Dilbert cartoon). She continued by looking at the traits needed to be an effective line manager or project manager within a technical team, identifying (as the session title suggests) that developers did in fact possess many of the requisite skills. Although I’m still not entirely convinced that a full-time management role is the right move for me personally, I can see how some aspect of mentoring or scrum mastering might not be entirely incompatible with my desire to retain a hands-on techie, and I will be seeking out some of the resources she mentioned to learn more.\nThere were a number of interesting short grok talks during lunchtime. I particularly enjoyed hearing Grant Crofton (@relentlessdev) describe his attempts to use functional programming to determine the most appropriate school for his son! That sounds like a slightly more practical means of developing skills in F# than my own efforts to use it solve some of the Project Euler problems.\n“Burnout Is Real And It’s Coming To Get You” was the title of Richard Dalton’s (@richardadalton) talk, which I consider to be the highlight of the day. Richard took a potentially worrying subject and gave hope and advice for all of us who have at some time felt ourselves to be at some point along the burnout continuum.\nI was particularly interested in the observation that it is precisely those of us who place a high value on our work (and are willing to give up a Saturday to attend a conference) who are likely to feel burned out and overly self-critical of our perceived inability to drive technical change or achieve as much as we would like.\nThe Agile movement, Richard suggested, was born as the result of an entire industry feeling burnt out and unable to get things done.\nHe cautioned us not to be jealous of or constantly compare ourselves to other developers, and to consider what aspects of life are poorer for those in our industry who are able to devote vast amounts of time to developing open source frameworks or writing popular blogs. I was also pleased to hear someone else mention the guilt that they feel when they choose to spend their hard-earned free time reading for pleasure instead of being glued to PluralSight or reading tech books. We do need to go easier on ourselves if we’re in this for the long haul.\nThe issue of age naturally came up – Richard concluded that there is no discernable mental decline between a programmer aged 20 and the same aged 40, it’s just that we have many more demands on our time around this age, leaving us with less contingency time to catch up on the less productive days. If we make it through this period in our lives without quitting the industry, it was suggested that things could actually be easier in our 50s as children become more self-sufficient and we once again have some time to spare.\nIn summary, it was a very reassuring talk, wrapped up with helpful advice on how to handle burnout – what works and what doesn’t.\nIn recent years the projects that I have worked on have involved much web services work (both as a client and server), so I was interested to hear David Whitney’s (@david_whitney) “Lessons Learned Running A Public API” talk, full of tips gathered developing the Rest API for Justgiving.com\nThere was a good mixture of hard technical advice (how to handle versioning, authentication, what data formats to support..) along with softer ideas of the supporting work required to create and maintain a successful public API (generated documentation, SDKs, not being a slave to external requirements or a single client, getting a product manager).\nI was particularly struck by the openness of the approach recommended by David, which involved creating public Google groups to push support issues into the community, and making a public uptime page available. Lots of good tips from the trenches here. Once again, here was some real actionable advice from a session that we can take away and put into practice.\nAnd that (after the customary prize draws and closing comments), was that. Thanks to Andrew Westgarth, Black Marble, the University of Leeds, and all the sponsors and speakers for once again staging a vital event. The development community in the North would be much poorer without this large multi-track multi-session event, and I look forward to attending again next year.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/dddnorth-2014-review/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI had no excuse for not attending \u003ca href=\"http://dddnorth.co.uk/\"\u003eDDDNorth\u003c/a\u003e this year, as it was held at Leeds University, a relatively short drive from home.

Taking only two possible values, it is the most basic of all the data types we programmers use, and its existence is fundamental to all the code we write. At the end of the day, when all is said and done, everything we do is just a big bunch of ones and zeroes.\nI assert that this warm familiarity often causes us to make use of booleans when we really shouldn’t. In particular, I want to call out two specific uses of the boolean which I now consider to be anti-patterns and avoid wherever possible:\nAntipattern 1 – Methods that take boolean flag parameters We spend more time reading and interpreting code than we spend actually writing it. That line of code you’re absent-mindedly knocking out today will probably be read dozens of times by your colleagues and future developers. It behoves you to make your intentions as clear as possible at every opportunity. Ambiguity in code is a truly terrible thing. Don’t impede understanding of your intentions by using boolean parameters that at worst force the reader to navigate to the definition of the method being invoked, or at best require them to hover their mouse over the bool parameter to glimpse some intellisense insight.\nAn example – let’s take a look at a line of code which uses the NHibernate hbm2ddl tool to export the database schema:\nQuick – what do those trio of booleans do? It’s not remotely obvious and we are forced to consult the docs. How much nicer it would be if the API developers had opted instead to use a flags enumeration, similar to the RegexOptions enumeration in the System.Text.RegularExpressions namespace:\nMore often, I encounter boolean parameters in the wild where a developer has been charged with enhancing an existing method to behave slightly differently in some particular circumstance, leading to method calls along the lines of:\nWhat does the final parameter do? Again we have to rely on intellisense or navigating to the source. It’s too easy to add the boolean parameter and slow down everyone who follows in our wake. We should take the time to implement the correct solution, whether that be as simple as a separate method with a more specific name, or a polymorphic family of suitably-named classes that implement the same interface. This kind of boolean parameter, quick as it is to add, not only slows us down but is often symptomatic of a deeper flaw in the class design.\nDon’t even get me started on the optional parameters introduced in C# 4.0. It’s all too easy to invoke methods without noticing the existence of optional parameters with surprising defaults which can cause unexpected consequences. A sprinkling of syntactic sugar that can act as a catalyst for code decay.\n“Flag arguments are ugly. Passing a boolean into a function is a truly terrible practice. It immediately complicates the signature of the method, loudly proclaiming that this function does more than one thing. It does one thing if the flag is true and another if the flag is false!”\n— Robert C. Martin, Clean Code\nAs with many design principles, the visibility of the method is key in how problematic this code smell becomes. A boolean parameter on a private method, while a potential candidate for refactoring at a suitable time, is not the end of the world. But a boolean parameter on a public method, perhaps a member on a public interface, is a more pressing problem. Think very carefully before adding a boolean parameter to a method on a public API or other service boundary.\nAntipattern 2 – Methods that (unnecessarily) return booleans OK, so I’ve explained that I don’t much like methods that take boolean parameters. What about methods that return them?\nWell, I am an advocate of Command-Query Separation. Generally, if a method returns a bool I’m going to assume that it’s free of side effects and is answering a query, like this:\nConversely, when methods actually do stuff (i.e. commands), I wouldn’t expect them to return anything at all, least of all a boolean.\nOK, a couple of notable exceptions to this rule. I can just about cope with create/update methods returning an instance of the entity that has been saved, thus:\nand I admit to having a soft spot for the TryParse pattern where we expect the happy path to succeed on most occasions:\nbut booleans returned from methods that perform commands? Well that’s just pointless and confusing. Consider the method signature:\nWhy return a bool? What does it mean? That the method call was successful? Then why bother mentioning it?\nIf there is a problem of some kind (say, a user already exists with the specified email address), then throw a suitable exception with the necessary detail that I can choose to catch, log or allow to bubble up as I see fit. By returning a boolean, consumers of the method now need to both catch exceptions and inspect the return value (and what action would be appropriate anyway when faced with a context-free “false” return value?)\nCommand methods that return booleans feel like insecure children who need to boast of their every achievement. It’s OK to return void. Nobody will think any the less of you for simply doing what was asked and keeping quiet. Unix commands have been silently going about their business for years, and I feel that is an ethos that we developers should try to emulate. The era of the contrived return value that has to be dissected for meaning is long gone. Doing what was asked if possible, else throwing an appropriate exception is the twenty-first century way.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/back-to-basics-on-the-use-and-abuse-of-the-humble-boolean/","summary":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e— Stonecutter’s creed\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsider for a moment, if you will, the humble Boolean.

Now I give little consideration to what I’m called, and sell my services on the basis of what I can do, and the value I can bring to a project and an organisation.\nSo, imagine my surprise when I recently returned to my desk at a client site to find the certificate below resting on my keyboard. It seems my highborn masters had seen fit to dub me (with tongue firmly in cheek, I presume), as their “Star of the Week”!\nWhat had I done to deserve this honour?\nThe client had an existing solution to generate an XML feed summarising the information held within a database. Unfortunately this process was slow – it took around 45 seconds – and even though the output was aggressively cached, this was still causing a problem.\nI actually enjoy occasionally tackling problems like this, where there is an existing solution that meets all functional requirements and my task is simply to improve some nonfunctional requirement – make it faster, make it more maintainable, make it scalable, update the technology stack, etc. The goal is much clearer when you have a reference solution to mimic than when starting with a blank page and having to tease out acceptance criteria from fickle humans!\nUnsurprisingly, some baseline profiling revealed that the problems lay in the data access layer, and with the help of Hibernating Rhino’s Entity Framework Profiler, I was able to determine that over 35,000 separate database calls were being issued to create a file of a few megabytes.\nThis was possible because the data access was performed through a series of helper classes that wrapped the EF context and exposed mapped models. While this simplified the data access for most use cases, and helped to encapsulate low-level validation, it was a hindrance for any kind of aggregation or reporting requirement. Essentially the problem boiled down to the SELECT N+1 problem on steroids, with a large portion of the object graph steadily loaded into memory.\nWrapping isn’t always a helpful approach…\nThe answer, having first defined some automated integration tests based on the existing solution, was to avoid using the helpful wrapper/mapper classes and instead write some bespoke EF queries against the underlying data context. I tried to strike a balance between making as few queries as possible without becoming unmaintainable or requiring too many joins. And each query, rather than returning the entire entity, instead projected only the required properties into some anonymous types. A little in-memory post-processing then turned these projections into the desired output format.\nThe end result? A process that originally made over 35,000 database queries and took 45 seconds was reduced to one that required just 7 queries and completed in around 0.45 seconds.

But I digress…\nThat first printer cost my parents £169.99 – not an insignificant amount of money back in 1991. It printed onto tractor-feed paper, and I received a huge box of the stuff for Christmas. Theoretically it was also capable of printing onto standard A4 sheets too, but this involved so much hassle gingerly feeding individual sheets into the machine that it was simpler just to forget it and stick with the tractor feed option. As a result, all of my GCSE English coursework was submitted on somewhat crinkly US Letter sized tractor feed paper. It may not have been beautiful, but it was considerably more presentable than my handwriting, and I was determined to use the cutting-edge option, dammit!\nThe LC20 was controlled by four buttons which had to be pressed in odd combinations to trigger line feeds and page feeds (ask your parents), and to switch between one of the four inbuilt “fonts”. More complex settings could be made by poking at shy DIP switches with a biro. It was all a far cry from the wireless connection to embedded web servers that we’ve come to expect from our peripherals these days.\nAround the same time as this, I recall shelling out £60 for a Roctec “Roclite” External 1.44 Mb Floppy Drive, after reading exhaustive floppy drive reviews in the inaugural issue of Amiga Shopper.

I ponied up for a paid license when it made the transition from beta to RTM, and I recently shelled out again for an upgrade to version 2.\nWhy?! Why do this when plenty of test runners are free, or bundled with software I already own such as ReSharper and Visual Studio itself?\nTo answer that question I sorely wanted to write another “list post” as a follow-up to 12 Reasons Why I Love Unit Tests but as my draft progressed and my thoughts crystallised in front of me on the screen, I realised that all of the points I was trying to convey ultimately boil down to the same one reason:\nNCrunch Saves Me Time I missed out on the age of the punchcard, thank goodness. I don’t think I could have coped with the torpid feedback cycles that software developers of that era had to endure. Bob Martin describes the multi-day process entertainingly in his excellent book The Clean Coder – programs written on coding forms with a #2 pencil, typed up by key-punchers, desk-checked, loaded by the computer operators, and ultimately returned wrapped in a rubber band with a printout showing a compile error. It must have been utterly soul-destroying.\nDespite having started my own software development career a couple of decades after the use of punchcards died out, I have still been witness to several advancements that have reduced feedback cycle time, enabling complex yet high-quality systems to be developed and enhanced in a fraction of the time that was once possible. I’m thinking of techniques such as static code analysis, continuous integration, continuous delivery and of course the widespread adoption of automated testing.\nNCrunch Facilitates the TDD Discipline Done well, Test-Driven Development is a powerful, professional, technique that allows us to develop and maintain solid, clean code in a short time. But without the right tooling to support this process, TDD can feel painful, too much stop-start while we wait on the compiler or test runner, especially if we are deliberately using baby-step techniques such as “Fake It Till You Make It” or “Stair-Step Tests”. Consider the steps we might typically intend to take:\nIs it any wonder that we are tempted to cut corners when it comes to TDD?!\nBut consider what this process is like when the tooling does all the grunt work and context-switching for you in the background:\nWe are left with just the “interesting” steps, and the TDD process now flows naturally and instinctively. The IDE takes responsibility for constantly compiling and testing the code, and corners are less likely to be cut.\nI love this process. I like to make use of the big inexpensive monitors that the twenty-first century has blessed us with. I open up a window for the tests, another for the system under test, and one each for the NCrunch Tests and NCrunch Processing Queue windows – and then I have all I need on a single screen to code tight, well-tested, code at a quick pace:\nFor me it is this – the facilitation of TDD and the instant feedback – that is the killer benefit of NCrunch. The remaining features that I mention below are merely the icing on the cake, but they do all serve to save me time.\nNCrunch Puts Real-Time Code-Coverage Data In My Face Time was, we would gather test coverage metrics using tools like NCover or dotCover, perhaps running as part of a CI build on the server. Once in a while someone might even deem it worthwhile having a look at the output!\nWith NCrunch, the code coverage is displayed right there in the IDE on a line-by-line basis as you code, with any uncovered lines sticking out like a sore thumb.\nIf you really want to see overall metrics for the solutions, NCrunch also provides a separate Metrics window.\nNCrunch Doesn’t Make Me Hunt For Error Messages When my code fails a test assertion, or even when it fails to compile, the reasons, just like the code-coverage data, are right there in my face, almost immediately. I don’t have to go hunting for the problem, I can access the compiler errors or stack traces for failed assertions without leaving the window in which I’m coding.\nNCrunch Highlights Slow-Running Lines of Code Powerful, expensive performance profiling tools such as Redgate Ants Performance Profiler and JetBrains dotTrace are often used to find bottlenecks in code that has already been developed and is often in production.\nNCrunch, as a somewhat unsung benefit, almost absent-mindedly gathers performance metrics as it continuously executes my tests, and highlights slow lines of code with a different coloured marker.\nGiven the existence of appropriate tests, this means that my attention is drawn to potential problems before the code is even committed to the source control repository.\nNCrunch is Super-Configurable Constant background compiling and test running obviously requires some significant computing resources. Fortunately, NCrunch is super-configurable in this regard. It’s easy to specify such things as the number of CPU cores that should be assigned to NCrunch, and the maximum number of processing threads. Not all the tests have to be run continuously – tests irrelevant to the work being undertaken can be ignored, or NCrunch can intelligently execute only those tests it determines are affected by changes.\nToday I was working on a small corner of a large .NET solution (60+ projects), so I deliberately told NCrunch to ignore most of those compo\nnents entirely, leaving it free to devote all its attention on the few assemblies I was currently enhancing. This resulted in faster feedback, saving me time!\nNCrunch Lets Me Utilise Other Computers’ Resources The latest version of NCrunch even lets me utilise the resources of any other computers or VMs that I may have at my disposal, enslaving them into my army of code compilers and test runners – buwahahahaha!\nIn the screenshots below you can see that I’ve sneakily added my kids’ laptop as another node in my NCrunch cluster, to offload some of the work from my development machine.\nWhat More Can I Say? NCrunch rocks. It has spoiled me for IDEs that don’t offer continuous compilation and testing functionality. The effortless manner in which it gives me feedback on the code and tests that I write every day is one of the things that keeps me interested in improving my .NET development skills after well over a decade at the code face.\nDisclaimer: Ian Nelson has not received any incentive or inducement to publish the commentary above.

So, let me say a few words about my experiences with that.\nFor the longest time, I had been perfectly content to use various Logitech VX / MX mouses as my secondary input device, occasionally using a Microsoft Arc Mouse (very convenient to carry around in my rucksack).\nBut in the Spring of 2010, I developed a nagging pain in my right forefinger. It sounds silly and trivial, but over the course of a couple of months it developed from a barely-susceptible twinge to something that was genuinely impacting my life – I struggled to open Coke bottles or turn the key in our garage door’s stiff lock.\nI turned for advice to Joe Steele, my personal guru of alternative input devices, and someone who I knew had previously suffered with RSI. Dr Steele confirmed that my symptoms mirrored those that he had experienced some years previously, and prescribed a course of two tablets – one for home use and one for client sites.\nThe Wacom Bamboo is an excellent piece of kit, and reasonably priced compared to other tablets and decent mouses. But it does take quite some getting used to. There is a knack to moving the pen around just above the surface of the tablet – a gap small enough that the movement is perceived by the tablet (and the mouse cursor moves), but without actually touching the tablet (which leads to dragging-and-dropping). This is particularly problematic if you venture anywhere near Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer – it was quite embarrassing how many times I checked strange folder/file moves into source control in the early days of my Bamboo usage. This acted as a good lesson to steer clear of Solution Explorer and get into the habit of navigating using ReSharper instead!\nOverall, it took me a good few months before I was as fast and accurate using the Bamboo as I was using a traditional mouse. This could be quite frustrating when I just wanted to get something done, and on a number of occasions The Wife snuck into my office and caught me of an evening, guiltily risking my health with an old VX Revolution. As with many things, perseverance is the key – having Bamboos at both home and work certainly helped. Over time the pain in my finger subsided and has now disappeared altogether.\nTwo specific tips if you’re thinking of giving the Wacom Bamboo a try for day-to-day computing use:\nFirstly, be sure to configure the device to use “Mouse Mode” rather than the default “Pen Mode”. Mouse mode “moves the screen cursor with a ‘pick up and slide’ motion similar to using a traditional mouse”, whilst Pen mode “sets the cursor so that its movement corresponds with the position of your Bamboo pen on the tablet – wherever you place your pen on the tablet, the cursor will jump to a corresponding point on the screen.” In my experience, Pen mode led to the cursor jumping wildly around the screen unless I gave consideration to where on the tablet I was placing the pen – a very unnatural experience after many years of using a “traditional” mouse.\nSecondly, I suggest mapping the lower button on the barrel of the pen to the “double-click” action, as trying to emulate a double-click by tapping the pen nib on the tablet twice in quick succession is awkward – a problem which compounds if you need to perform many double-clicks, such as navigating around a file hierarchy in Windows Explorer.\nI mentioned a few years ago that a keyboard makes a hell of a difference – well, it turns out that selection of secondary input devices can also make a huge difference to the long-term viability of a career, if you can invest the time to become proficient in their use.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/wacom-bamboo/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAlmost everyone who has wandered past the various desks that I’ve occupied over the last year has passed comment on my \u003ca href=\"http://amzn.to/1rrSHfo\"\u003eWacom Bamboo Pen Graphics Tablet\u003c/a\u003e.

It has also acquired a most surprising and welcome addition.\nMy Dad and his Granny, Isabella Birrell\nI’ve continued to concentrate on improving the quality and depth of the records and sources that I hold for more recent generations, rather than attempting to trace lines far into the dim and distant past. As more and more contemporary records are released into the public domain (and increasingly placed online as a matter of course), this task becomes easier, and throws up the possibility of making the kind of startling discovery that I encountered last Wednesday evening.\nThose of you living in the U.K. will be aware that every household was required by law to complete a decennial census return last month. A few days later, under the 100 year rule, the 1911 census of Scotland was made available online at the Scotland’s People website. I had been eagerly anticipating this event since developing an interest in my family history, so I wasted no time in scouring the records for additional details of my relatives from north of the border.\nIt wasn’t long before this new trove of data revealed that my great-grandmother, Isabella Birrell, had an additional sibling that I wasn’t previously aware of, named on the 1911 census as “Annie”, aged 5.\nA quick cross-reference with the birth records and I learned that the full name of my newly-found great-great-aunt was Ann Cunningham Birrell, born 1905.\nI then searched the marriage records to see if Ann had ever wed, which was when things started to take an unexpected twist:\nJohn Conners from Dundee? Now why does that ring a bell?\nOh yeah! That’ll be it! I have a very good friend named John Conners who I met when we worked together at Marshalls for a little over two years, and he hails from Dundee too! Coincidence? I dropped him a quick email containing details of Ann and his namesake. Thirty minutes later I received his reply:\nWell, it looks like this. John’s grandmother is the younger sister (by almost 20 years) of my great-grandmother Isabella. Which makes John and I second cousins once removed!\nTo be honest this news is still sinking in, and I’m not sure what comments to make or conclusions to draw. Except to say that it truly is a small world, and when embarking on seemingly prosaic family tree investigations, you just never know what you might discover. After five years of “bone-digging” and adding the names of often ancient and obscure relatives into my family tree, it’s a very strange feeling to be adding the details of a good friend and erstwhile colleague to that same database.\nOh, and John – welcome to the family, cousin!\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/its-a-small-world/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt’s been a long time since I posted a blog entry tagged with “\u003ca href=\"https://blog.iannelson.uk/tag/genealogy\"\u003egenealogy\u003c/a\u003e” (over three years, in fact).

The introductory post in the series is here.\nI am lucky to have had the opportunity to spend a time-boxed period playing with Entity Framework Code-First in a real-world scenario, and to get paid for the privilege! I now have a clearer understanding of how it has progressed during the last few years, what its strong points are, and where it still has shortcomings compared to the much more mature NHibernate framework.\nThe Positives I have to say that after a week of getting through the pain barrier and the initial denial of working with an unfamiliar ORM, I have reached a level of understanding and acceptance with Entity Framework. It really isn’t all that bad (at least the Code-First flavour), and if you don’t stray too far from its rigid way of thinking it will help you to get a solution up and running quickly and reliably. It’s certainly a far preferable option than mucking about with ADO.NET and stored bloody procedures, that’s for sure.\nThe whole process of configuration and initialization is straightforward and pain-free, with the derived DbContext providing a out-of-the-box implementation of Unit of Work already to be referenced from your consuming code. Easy.\nQuerying the model is 99% unadulterated LINQ, with the occasional call to Include to perform some eager fetching – what could be simpler?\nI’m also unashamedly impressed with how easily EF can be used to power ASP.NET Dynamic Data sites, and RESTful WCF Data Services. Nice.\nThe Negatives I found that the real pain of working with Entity Framework only surfaces when you wish to start tuning its behaviour in any way – you find that it’s a big black box with few extensibility points. It performs cunning tricks effortlessly, but wields its power in a largely indiscriminate manner. By comparison, NHibernate can achieve even greater things, but requires you to explicitly invoke these powers.\nI am reminded of a response Ayende gave when asked why NH Futures was not the default behaviour – “NHibernate tries hard not to make too much magic”. I thought it sounded glib at the time, but having lived with EF for a while, I now understand why this is preferable.\nMost of the NHibernate features that are missing from Entity Framework are related to performance – such as the ability to configure query batching, write batching, bulk operations, extra-lazy properties, and second-level caching. These are the features you’ll miss the most when you’re some way into a project, perhaps not until it’s in production and scalability issues arise.\nI also feel the CTP5 of EF code-first is a little way off offering true support for persistence ignorance and POCO, having experienced a number of issues that required me to change my domain model, database schema, and application code.\nAdditional Resources Here are a few of the resources that I found particularly useful during my EF week:\nProgramming Entity Framework, Second Edition Dino Esposito – A Feature-Driven Comparison of EF and NH ADO.NET Team Blog Using DbContext in EF Feature CTP5 – a series of 12 blog posts David Ebbo – Using Dynamic Data With EF Code First and NuGet ","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/entity-framework-week-part-5-concluding-thoughts/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is the fifth in a series of five posts recounting my experiences using Entity Framework Code-First to replace ADO.NET and stored procedures in a client’s existing application. \u003ca href=\"https://blog.iannelson.uk/entity-framework-week-part-1-introduction-configuration-and-initialization/\"\u003eThe introductory post in the series is here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am lucky to have had the opportunity to spend a time-boxed period playing with \u003ca href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399572.aspx\"\u003eEntity Framework\u003c/a\u003e Code-First in a real-world scenario, and to get paid for the privilege!

The introductory post in the series is here.\nI didn’t want this series of posts to descend into a point-scoring NHibernate-versus-Entity Framework comparison, but…\nI now have a basic proof-of-concept up and running, with my client’s nascent application now being powered by Entity Framework Code-First CTP5 rather than a hand-rolled DAL. So, I had some time to consider future functional and non-functional requirements that the team would be asked to develop and support, and investigate how EF would meet the challenge.\nCaching I was genuinely surprised to learn that Entity Framework still doesn’t include any out-of-the-box support for integrating second-level caching, for example to cache reference data. It seems there is a body of opinion stating that caching should not be the responsibility of the data access layer. I disagree, and I think this is one of the major benefits NHibernate still has over Entity Framework, with its multiple flexible and configurable second-level cache providers.\nTargeting Alternative Providers (SQLite) When working with NHibernate, I often target SQLite for fast integration tests against an in-memory database, rather than maintaining a testing version of the MSSQL/Oracle databases that my applications usually use for their bitbucket. I was pleased to see the discussions on the System.Data.SQLite page suggesting that this approach is possible with Entity Framework too, but I didn’t spend any time attempting to get this working.\nAuditing Functionality Entity Framework does not appear to support the rich events and listeners model that is offered by NHibernate and frequently used to develop application auditing functionality. The recommended solution to achieve this scenario is to override the virtual SaveChanges method on DbContext and add validation and auditing logic there. For more details, see page 261 of Programming Entity Framework.\nBulk Operations I have not yet encountered any Entity Framework support for bulk update/delete operations akin to NHibernate’s Executable DML functionality. Such requirements are usually relatively rare, but it’s a shame to have to fall back to writing stored procedures for relatively simple operations which can be described in terms of the domain model.\nQuery Batching There does not appear to be any way to do query batching in Entity Framework, as per NHibernate Futures. Multiple queries result in multiple network trips to the database, sadly. Similarly, there’s no support for write batching and batched collection loads.\nConcurrency and Versioning Entity framework supports optimistic concurrency. Chapter 23 of Programming Entity Framework explains in detail how this can be configured and utilised by your application. Entity Framework also supports rowversion fields for concurrency checks.\nExtra-Lazy Properties Unlike NHibernate, Entity Framework currently has no notion of “extra-lazy” properties. Requesting the Count of a child collection (e.g. Order.Lines.Count) will therefore trigger the loading of all entities (Lines) in the child collection. Not nice. Yes, we can work around this by making the appropriate count query at a higher level but it’s much nicer to be able to traverse the domain model relationships and let persistence ignorance work it’s magic.\nIntegration with the Wider .NET Stack To my mind, one of the key selling points of Entity Framework over NHibernate is its out-of-the-box integration with other areas of the .NET stack – notably the ability to power ASP.NET Dynamic Data sites (which are great for simple pages to maintain reference data) and WCF Data Services.\nQuery Techniques NHibernate offers a world of choice when it comes to methods for querying the model: HQL, Criteria, QueryOver, LINQ, Named Queries, etc. These each offer a plethora of possible options and tweaks including query caching, batching and futures. By comparison, Entity Framework offers a comprehensive LINQ provider (with decent extensions to specify eager-loading of child entities), or Entity SQL. And that’s your lot.\nBy the end of my fourth day, I had a working proof-of-concept using Entity Framework Code First to power my client’s application, and I had a good idea of how suitable it was to meet future requirements lurking in the product backlog.\nIn the fifth and final part of this series of posts, I’ll write some concluding thoughts on my overall experiences spending a week with Entity Framework.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/entity-framework-week-part-4-features-and-further-investigations/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is the fourth in a series of five posts recounting my experiences using Entity Framework Code-First to replace ADO.NET and stored procedures in a client’s existing application. \u003ca href=\"https://blog.iannelson.uk/entity-framework-week-part-1-introduction-configuration-and-initialization/\"\u003eThe introductory post in the series is here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t want this series of posts to descend into a point-scoring \u003ca href=\"http://www.nhforge.org\"\u003eNHibernate\u003c/a\u003e-versus-\u003ca href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399572.aspx\"\u003eEntity Framework\u003c/a\u003e comparison, but…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI now have a basic proof-of-concept up and running, with my client’s nascent application now being powered by Entity Framework Code-First CTP5 rather than a hand-rolled DAL.

The introductory post in the series is here.\nHaving configured and initialized Entity Framework, and tweaked the mappings, by Day 3 I was all set to start consuming my shiny new DbContext implementation from the application code, and actually get some CRUD work done. Not unexpectedly, I hit a few issues along the way…\nProxy Generation As a long-term NHibernate user, I habitually mark all members on my domain classes as virtual, since this is a requirement for entities to be replace at runtime by proxies. Remember that NHibernate is a port from the Java world, where all instance methods are virtual by default.\nNow, this habit led to some unexpected behaviour when I attempted to use Entity Framework to persist the same domain objects, namely exception messages such as:\nThe property ‘Foo’ on type ‘Bar_B6089AE40D178593955F1328A70EAA3D8F0F01DDE9F9FBD615F60A34F9178B94’ cannot be set because the collection is already set to an EntityCollection.\nClear as mud, eh? A little Googling eventually unearthed the following posts from other people experiencing this issue:\nWhy is my Entity Framework Code First proxy collection null and why can’t I set it? Code First adding to collections? How to use Code First with repositories? Advice me please Code First EF4 with N-Tier.. I’m really stuck on this one issue This latter post on the MSDN forums includes the following explanation from one of the guys on the Entity Framework team:\n“If you make all your properties virtual then EF will generate proxy classes at runtime that derives from your POCO classed, these proxies allow EF to find out about changes in real-time rather than having to capture the original values of your object and then scan for changes when you save (this is obviously has performance and memory usage benefits but the difference will be negligible unless you have a large number of entities loaded into memory). These are known as ‘change tracking proxies’, if you make your navigation properties virtual then a proxy is still generated but it is much simpler and just includes some logic to perform lazy loading when you access a navigation property.\nBecause your original code was generating change tracking proxies, EF was replacing your collection property with a special collection type to help it find out about changes. Because you try and set the collection back to a simple list in the constructor you are getting the exception.\nUnless you are seeing performance issues I would follow Terrence’s suggestion and just remove ‘virtual’ from your non-navigation properties.”\nThis feels a little bit strange, and I’m not convinced that we are really getting persistence ignorance if we experience differing behaviour depending on whether or not we have chosen to make all our members virtual. I haven’t invested much time looking into the benefits of these “Change-Tracking Proxies”, or how it is possible to utilise these without causing the “collection is already set to an EntityCollection” exception. I just did what the man said and removed the virtual keyword from most non-navigation properties.\nA Runtime Exception When Lazy-Loading At one point I experienced an exception message along the lines of:\n“Entities in ‘CodeFirstContainer_Sessions’ participate in the ‘Session_Season’ relationship. 0 related ‘Session_Season_Target’ were found. 1 ‘Session_Season_Target’ is expected.”\nThis was caused by my navigation property (Session.Season) not having been set as virtual, so no proxy was being created.\nIncidentally, it is worth highlighting that lazy-loading must occur within the scope of an open DbContext (i.e. within the Unit of Work). It is not reasonable to expect to transparently load the navigation property after the database connection has been closed (this is analogous to attempting to lazy-load in NHibernate after closing the Session).\nCascades In NHibernate, cascading saves/updates/deletes have to be specified manually on all foreign key relationships – the default behaviour is not to cascade any changes when committing changes, which often leads to newcomers experiencing an error message “not-null property references a null or transient value”.\nEntity Framework takes a more convention-based approach and assumes that all saves and updates should cascade. So, if you save a shiny new Order with an associated Address and a handful of Lines, Entity Framework will determine that it should first insert the Address row, then the Order row, and then each Line row. Sweet. Updates similarly cascade. Assuming you are happy with this behaviour (which seems sensible), then all should be well.\nDeletes, on the other hand, are a bit strange. Entity Framework will not take responsibility for cascading a delete in the database – it expects that you will achieve this by setting a cascading delete on the foreign key relationship in the RDBMS.\nHaving said this, if you delete a parent entity in Entity Framework, it will attempt to issue delete statements for any child entities which have been loaded into the current DbContext, but it will not initialize any child entities which have not yet been loaded. This may lead to the RDBMS throwing foreign key constraint violation exceptions if a cascading delete has not been specified. For more details about how cascade delete “works” in Entity Framework, see this blog post.\nPersonally, I think this behaviour is pretty shoddy, but there you have it! Forewarned is forearmed.\nIn light of this behaviour I had to make modifications to the database schema to set cascading deletes on all the appropriate foreign key relationships. For many line-of-business applications, deletes are actually pretty rare events, and in the short term I suspect this issue is more likely to be encountered when clearing down data in integration tests than in actual application use.\nInitializing Child Objects on Domain Entities I habitually add code to the constructors of domain entities to initialise child entities to sensible defaults – I find it helps to ensure that objects are always in a valid state, and reduces the likelihood of encountering an unhandled NullReferenceException. So, for example, I would usually have something like this:\nUnfortunately, when using this approach with Entity Framework, I found that when loading an existing Order which has an associated Address, the Order.Address object was always reset to its default.\nNow, I realise that making calls to virtual members in a constructor is not really a good idea (heaven knows Resharper and Coderush have both nagged me about it often enough), but NHibernate never had a problem with\nthis approach. Nevertheless, I tried to do things properly and replaced the automatic properties with backing fields….\nBut still no dice. I then tried putting initialization logic in the property’s getter….\nBut nothing worked. Every time I loaded an Order, the Order.Address object was reset back to its default instead of containing the data loaded from the database.\nThis is quite frustrating and as yet I haven’t been able to find a workaround, other than to abandon my plans to perform object initialization in the domain model and instead handle it in the service layer, with all the resultant null-checking code that will ensue.\nWhile trying to find a solution, I did stumble across this comment from Rowan Miller that “More flexibility in how we interact with classes is a common ask for EF and our team is looking at how we can support this at the moment.” Are we asking for flexibility? I thought we were just asking for the persistence ignorance that had long been promised.\nDespite these issues, in three short days I had gone from knowing next to nothing about Entity Framework 4 Code first, to using it to perform almost all of the data access required by a small application. In the fourth part of this series I’ll consider some of the additional features and application requirements that I would expect an ORM to handle, and see how EF meets the challenge.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/entity-framework-week-part-3-runtime-issues-encountered/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is the third in a series of five posts recounting my experiences using Entity Framework Code-First to replace ADO.NET and stored procedures in a client’s existing application. \u003ca href=\"https://blog.iannelson.uk/entity-framework-week-part-1-introduction-configuration-and-initialization/\"\u003eThe introductory post in the series is here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving configured and initialized \u003ca href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399572.aspx\"\u003eEntity Framework\u003c/a\u003e, and tweaked the mappings, by Day 3 I was all set to start consuming my shiny new DbContext implementation from the application code, and actually get some CRUD work done.

The introductory post in the series is here.\nAs mentioned in yesterday’s post, I was attempting to use Entity Framework Code-First CTP5 to map an existing domain model to an existing database schema. Fortunately the project was in its infancy and there was a high degree of cohesion between the two models. I therefore didn’t anticipate too many difficulties ahead – the occasional naming discrepancy to resolve, and table-per-hierarchy mappings that would need their discriminators specifying – nothing too complicated really. I hoped to make as few changes as possible to either the database schema or domain model.\nEntity Framework Code-First uses a set of conventions to “discover” the mappings from domain objects to database. This is broadly analogous to James Gregory’s Fluent NHibernate AutoMapping functionality.\nAs with Fluent NHibernate, it is possible to add custom conventions, and to manually override mappings for specific properties which deviate from the conventions. It is also possible to remove existing conventions.\nAll of these modifications to the model mappings are affected by overriding the virtual OnModelCreating method in our concrete implementation of DbContext. I was initially worried about the sheer volume of code that might be included in this method, and was relieved to discover that mapping overrides related to particular entities can be separated out into the constructor of generic implementations of EntityTypeConfiguration, not unlike the generic ClassMap in Fluent NHibernate.\nCustom Conventions In the domain model I was working with, all entities were derived from an abstract base Entity class which defined an integer Id property. By contrast, the primary keys on the database tables were all prefixed with the name of the table/entity. Neither of these situations are ideal, but nor are they all that unusual, and I sought a way of “teaching” this convention to our custom EF context.\nIt took me some time to discover that custom conventions are even possible in CTP5, and I had initially resigned myself to manually overriding the names of each and every primary key property. It was only through stumbling upon this post on the ADO.NET team blog that I found what I was looking for. Note that this post does include the caveat “There are a number of rough edges and the API surface is likely to change”.\nMy first impression is that custom Entity Framework conventions could turn out to be far more powerful than those offered by Fluent NHibernate, but they are also trickier to develop, requiring an understanding of the valid options for the two generic parameters that IConfigurationConvention can take, and what actions should be taken by the custom convention.\nStill, after a little trial and error I was able to write the custom primary key convention that I required:\nI was disappointed that I had to insert a guard clause to ignore this convention for the concrete subclasses of hierarchies that are mapped using table-per-hierarchy (i.e. ProductFeature and ProductInsert). Given time I would hope to find a generic way of achieving this convention that doesn’t require hardcoded references to specific Domain objects from within the convention definition.\nCompare and contrast with the equivalent code for Fluent NHibernate:\nUpdated:\nSince I wrote the section above, the ADO.NET team have announced details of the forthcoming Entity Framework 4.1 Release Candidate, which removes this ability add conventions:\n“This was a very painful decision but we have decided to remove the ability to add custom conventions for our first RC/RTW. It has become apparent we need to do some work to improve the usability of this feature and unfortunately we couldn’t find time in the schedule to do this and get quality up the required level. You will still be able to remove our default conventions in RC/RTW.”\nFor what it’s worth, I think this was the right decision to make. A lack of “pluggable” conventions is slightly disappointing, but it can easily be worked around by making the appropriate overrides with the fluent mappings. Better to hold off an nail an API that’s both powerful and usable than go too soon with something that’s liable to confuse and confound.\nRemoval of Default Conventions Another nice feature described in the Pluggable Conventions blog post is the ability to remove some of the default conventions, which I immediately put to good use by disabling the default PluralizingTableNameConvention:\n(I mean, for goodness sake, who in their right mind pluralizes table names anyway? Yes, it’s very impressive that this library knows that the plural of “goose” is “geese”, but it would be more beneficial if that were an extension method on System.String in the BCL rather than being buried in the bowels of System.Data.Entity.Design. Then perhaps the ADO.NET team could be left to get on with developing something more useful, like second-level caching? Sorry, rant over…)\nFluent Mapping API Most manual tweaks to the model are fairly straightforward to perform, and there are a good set of examples in this post on the ADO.NET team blog.\nI did encounter some difficulty with the mapping of one-to-many relationships, which felt quite cumbersome to perform in comparison to the brevity of Fluent NHibernate’s API. Here’s how you’d rename a foreign key on a unidirectional one-to-many relationship in Fluent NHibernate:\nWhilst in Entity Framework code-first, the equivalent is:\nTo be fair, I think part of this clumsiness arises because Entity Framework is allowing us to define both ends of a bidirectional relationship in a single place, whereas NHibernate requires us to define each end separately. It’s just unfortunate that in unidirectional situations like this example we end up with the WithMany().IsIndependent() noise in the middle of the syntax.\nHaving learned the odd syntax required to rename these one-to-many foreign keys, I then wasted an inordinate amount of time trying to make this actually work. Many of my waking hours were blighted by an InvalidOperationException (“Sequence contains more than one matching element”) originating from deep within the framework. A quick ferret aro\nund on Stack Overflow revealed that I was not the only person currently banging his or her head on this particular brick wall:\nEF Code First CTP5 – Using the name of the property as column name for foreign key Entity Framework 4 CTP 5 Self Referencing Many-to-Many Entity framework (CTP5, Fluent API). Rename column of navigation property Eventually Diego Mijelshon figured out what was amiss. It seems the mapping failure was due to the Id property being defined in a base class rather than on the concrete class being mapped.

Being the NHibernate fanboy that I am, I naturally attempted to persuade them of the benefits of moving over to NH, even going so far as to develop (in my own time) an NH-powered version of their application.\nMy efforts were partially successful. The team were sold on the idea of using an ORM, but wanted me to develop a second proof of concept using Microsoft ADO.NET Entity Framework rather than NHibernate. This prompted much mirth amongst my FaceBook friends.\nI decided to throw myself into the task, and use this opportunity to spend some time getting to grips with Entity Framework in a real-life scenario for a couple of weeks. I figured that in the best-case scenario, I would learn to love EF even more than NH, and bolster my CV. Worst case, I’d hate it but would be moving on to a new contract shortly anyway, so wouldn’t have to live with it for too long. And of course I was getting paid for the experience either way, so what’s not to like?!\nA couple of friends rightly suggested that I ought to blog about my experiences, so here we go.\nThis series of five blog posts details the thoughts and experiences I encountered during my week-long adventure with Entity Framework. It isn’t an EF walkthrough, nor is it a comprehensive EF-vs-NH feature comparison (the web is littered with those).\nIntroduction, Configuration and Initialization Conventions and Fluent Mappings Runtime Issues Encountered Features and Further Investigations Concluding Thoughts Choosing Code-First When last I had a quick play with Entity Framework in the summer of 2008, it was very IDE and database-driven – the development process entailed dragging tables onto a designer surface which generated partial classes to represent objects, etc. Yuk! The lack of support for a domain-driven, persistence-ignorant approach was a real turn-off for me, prompting me to add my name to the list of signatories on the infamous ADO.NET Entity Framework Vote of No Confidence.\nIt was therefore a relief to discover that Entity Framework now supports a “Code-First” development paradigm, whereby EF can be used like a traditional ORM to fluently map an existing domain model to an existing database. At the time, this was still available only as a Community Technology Preview (CTP5), but given my remit was to introduce EF to an existing solution, it was a no-brainer to choose this option for the proof of concept, even though this would potentially leave me exposed to bugs and breaking API changes.\nConfiguration Configuring Entity Framework seemed a lot easier than the equivalent procedure with NHibernate, filled as it is with esoteric options which can often be somewhat perplexing to NH newbies. With EF, the walkthroughs told me that essentially, all I needed to do was create a subclass of DbContext and Bob would be my mother’s brother. They were right. If anything, it was all too easy, and I wondered how and where I would get the option to configure details such as the second-level cache provider and ADO batch size.\nI made use of a constructor overload on DbContext which takes a string parameter called nameOrConnectionString. Initially I attempted to pass into this parameter a connection string obtained from the app.config file using System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager, but this led to error messages along the lines of\n“Unable to determine the provider name for connection of type ‘System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection’”\nIt seems that the connection strings used by Entity Framework are not the common or garden connection strings that we know and love, but instead special EF connection strings. Fortunately, a simple remedy to this issue was to instead just pass the connection string name into the exact same parameter. See this forum post for more details.\nDatabase Initializer Strategies Entity Profiler revealed that Entity Framework was unsuccessfully attempting to access a nonexistent database table called dbo.EdmMetadata. A little light Googling revealed that this is used by Entity Framework to store (perhaps unsurprisingly) metadata about the Entity Data Model. Why does it do this? Presumably so that it can decide at application start up whether code changes to the model require it to automagically make associated changes to the database schema. Some Summer 2010 blog posts from Scotts Guthrie and Hanselman show off the ability of Entity Framework to automatically create and update databases in response to model changes.\nNow, this is all very clever and might be fine for hobbyist websites, integration tests and those quintessential “Look – no code!” TechEd presentations, but in an enterprise scenario it’s liable to cause acute apoplexy in DBAs.\nFortunately we can opt to suppress this crazy behaviour altogether by passing a null strategy into DbDatabase.SetInitializer, thus:\nThat was day one over – I was officially up and running in the brave new (to me) world of Entity Framework. In part two of this series I’ll take a look at the mapping tweaks I had to make to successfully map our existing domain model to our existing database.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/entity-framework-week-part-1-introduction-configuration-and-initialization/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn February 2011 I found myself doing some contract development work in a team that was still doing data access using raw ADO.NET and stored procedures.

That is, the suggestion that Application A can leverage the functionality of Application B by simply adding references to B’s DLLs. After all, this potential for reuse is why we put our code in reusable assemblies in the first place, isn’t it..?!\nWell, no. Actually we usually break our application apart into assemblies to create a maintainable and testable architecture. An assembly is a coarse-grained unit of encapsulated functionality in that architecture; the fact that it is the smallest deployable unit in the .NET world is not necessarily an indication that we intend or desire our assemblies to be shared with other applications.\nIn my experience, sharing assemblies works only when they have been developed with this intention in mind. It’s feasible to share DLLs that contain discrete chunks of easily-encapsulated functionality that have no need for external dependencies (hasn’t every dev shop got a “common” or “utilities” library hanging around somewhere?!) but it’s quite another matter to start taking a wholesale dependency on the guts of another application.\nSo, before you try the shared assemblies approach to enterprise integration, here are a few things to consider:\nIs It Even Possible? Firstly, this approach makes the assumption that the application to be referenced has been developed such that all the logic to be invoked exists in the assemblies. If the application wasn’t originally developed with the intention of being shared in this way, there’s every possibility that some pertinent logic has instead been located in the front-end (e.g. the “Magic Pushbutton” anti-pattern that was so prevalent in ASP.NET Web Forms development), or even client-side scripts.\nLove Me, Love My Dependencies… All applications have dependencies of one kind or another. If you’re lucky, this will just be the .NET Framework, and if you’re especially lucky it will be the same version that is used by the consuming application.\nMore likely, the application being referenced will depend on a whole bunch of third-party DLLs, and now they’ve suddenly become your dependencies, too! If your dev shop is anything like the places I’ve worked, each application will depend on various different versions of the NHibernate and Castle stacks and their associated dependencies. Good luck managing all those references while retaining your sanity.\nApplications are more than just DLLs The average enterprise application is more than just a bunch of assemblies that can be referenced independently. They also tend to rely on configuration settings, external resources (e.g. databases), and a whole bunch of stuff triggered at application start-up time such as the configuration of an IoC container, logging, ORM, etc. The handling of authentication and authorization might also need rethinking before assembly sharing becomes a viable option.\nMaintaining the Combined Suite of Applications As I said in my previous post on this topic, maintainability is a particular bugbear of mine as a developer, and sharing assemblies across multiple applications doesn’t help matters one iota.\nUnless you work with unbearably large solutions containing every project in your suite of applications, it’s difficult to know the wider impact that modifications will have, and to avoid making breaking changes. For sure, it’s possible to run automated builds of all applications when shared code is changed (I blogged about one method of achieving this with the first version of Team Foundation Server some years ago before I came to the conclusion that this is A Bad Idea) but by then the hard work has been done, the code checked in and the damage done.\nArguably, sharing assemblies puts developers in an even stickier situation than sharing databases – at least with that anti-pattern the entanglement is limited to one particular layer of the architecture which can be largely ignored much of the time. But when assemblies are shared, the developers must always be considering whether their apparently innocent modifications will have an impact on some other application. Meaningful refactoring becomes impossible, and the software eventually falls into disrepair.\nIn Conclusion… When all is said and done, there are only two realistic patterns for sharing functionality between enterprise applications – remote procedure invocation and messaging. Both serve to decouple the applications, and both are easy to achieve with popular technologies on the .NET stack such as WCF, OpenRasta and MassTransit.\nThere’s an abundance of resources out there detailing how to create effective service-oriented architectures, the obvious canonical reference tome being Hohpe and Woolf’s Enterprise Integration Patterns. I also highly recommend Michael Nygard’s Release It! for an entertaining overview of some of the problems that can be encountered when you start taking dependencies on remote services, and useful patterns for ensuring your application remains responsive at all times.\nMy preferred technology stack for application integration remains WCF, and in a future blog post I’ll outline some tips I’ve learned through trial and error for developing and consuming effective and maintainable WCF services.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/enterprise-integration-anti-patterns-2-shared-assemblies/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHaving slain the beast that is \u003ca href=\"https://blog.iannelson.uk/enterprise-integration-anti-patterns-1-the-shared-database/\"\u003eShared Database\u003c/a\u003e, the next dragon to appear on my Enterprise Integration horizon is Shared Assemblies.

I made a massive mistake at the beginning by calling idea.Comments.Count (even worse, I did it in the view!), which due to the collection being lazy-loaded caused about 10 database calls so performance was sluggish even with second level cache. I was therefore wondering how you would do it – would you use HQL and use Comments.size or would you do something differently?”\nNow, I’ve been pretty busy recently, so before I had opportunity to respond properly, he sent this follow-up:\n\u0026ldquo;After looking for a solution for getting a Comment count back for each Idea, I found using the Nhibernate Formula method does the job – just wanting to make sure I was on the right track in terms of performance etc. My mapping class is as follows:\u0026rdquo;\nI considered this for a while, and sent the following suggestions:\n“I’m glad to hear you resolved your SELECT N+1 problem but to be honest, I’m not a big fan of using formulas in NH mappings if at all possible, for the following reasons:\nI try to minimize my use of strings (and especially SQL) so as to make refactorings easier, and lessen the potential for runtime exceptions. The default NH behaviour will be to evaluate that formula every time an Idea entity is loaded, which might not be desirable and could negatively impact on performance when loading your idea entities. I’m not sure if the recently-added Lazy Properties feature of NH can be applied to these derived properties; if so then that could be used to negate this argument. I try to avoid putting logic (however simple) in the OR mapping layer, as future developers are unlikely to expect to find it there! I like to reduce the element of surprise in my solutions, and put such logic in the domain layer. I think logic in the OR layer limits options going forward – for example if you subsequently decide all comments have to be moderated, does the CommentCount formula have to be modified to exclude comments awaiting moderation..? So, what would I do? Here are two options, depending on how often you’re using the CommentCount property:\nIf you’re only using the CommentCount occasionally and only along with a subset of the other properties from Idea, then I would write a specific query returning a projection of the required properties, including this CommentCount aggregate.\nI’ve done this in the past where I had a requirement to populate a drop-down list with user names and the number of open work items assigned to each user, for example. I didn’t want or need to maintain an ActiveWorkItemCount property on the user object, I just wanted to do the calculation in one place (incidentally, LINQ made this a doddle).\nConversely, if the CommentCount property is something you’re going to be referencing frequently, then I would denormalise the database and add a CommentCount field to the Idea table. This presumes that you’re in a position to enforce the constraint that new Comments are only added to Ideas through your application (and as you know from my recent blog post, I am very fond of this kind of constraint!). This approach should give the best performance and flexibility, at the expense of irking normalisation fascists.\nTypically this would be done by creating AddComment and RemoveComment helper methods on the Idea entity, which can maintain a bidirectional relationship between Idea and Comment in addition to incrementing or decrementing CommentCount accordingly.\nThis approach will give the best performance, and keeps the logic where it belongs (and where it can be easily extended and tested, as in my earlier hypothetical comment moderation example).\nFor a good example of code to maintain bidirectional one-to-many class relationships with NHibernate, see pages 39-43 of NHibernate 3.0 Cookbook.\nHope this helps. As ever, it’s just my opinion, but these two techniques have worked well for me.”\nWhat do you think?

My poor app, what had it done to deserve this despicable treatment?\nBefore I start my rant about the downsides of directly accessing application databases in this way, let me first try to enumerate the benefits of such an approach. I can think of three:\nIt’s a quick solution to develop (at least initially). The technical concepts involved are well understood by the vast majority of developers and other team members. The functionality is encapsulated in one place, i.e. the stored proc, which is at least preferable to allowing the execution of ad-hoc SQL. But despite this being seen as a quick-win, I think allowing application databases to be shared in this way is almost always a bad idea in the medium to long term.\nAs a developer, one of my primary goals is to create systems that are easy to maintain and enhance, in anticipation of the inevitable future change requests that will put food on my children’s plates. As well as making life easier for yourself, this approach is also common courtesy to the programmers that maintain the system after you’ve left. As the saying goes, “always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live” – I think that’s good advice to heed for all developers who have an interest in building their reputation in our small and incestuous industry.\nWhen we begin down the slippery slope of forcing a single database to serve the needs of multiple disparate consuming systems, we make a rod for our own backs. Any planned changes to the database to meet new requirements in the primary application need to consider the needs of the parasitic applications that care little for your ability to respond to change as long as they continue working. In our particular scenario, it’s worth highlighting that “my” application is using NHibernate as an ORM layer, so until this invasion we have been able to perform database schema refactorings with relative impunity. No longer – now we have to consider and potentially maintain someone else’s stored procedure when making changes.\nSure, at the start it’s “just a stored proc”, and the maintenance overhead is relatively low. But like the proverbial broken window, allowing that first chink in your carefully-crafted layered application architecture sets a dangerous precedent. If it goes unchecked, it may be seen as a valid pattern to be emulated by future developers, until the database schema ossifies and becomes almost impossible to change as it struggles to meet the requirements of multiple consuming applications.\nIf you think I’m scaremongering or labouring a point here I would urge you to spend some time hanging out on the NHibernate and Fluent NHibernate mailing lists. It won’t be long before you see messages that describe complex and intractable mapping problems and mention the caveat “I’m not allowed to change the database”.\nAside from the maintainability issue (which is my major gripe), the end result of this quick-and-dirty approach also leads to a poorer-quality solution which may struggle to meet nonfunctional requirements. Direct database access from external applications is a crude, low-level solution to a common problem. All the hard work done in creating a layered architecture with DAOs, business logic layer etcetera is swept aside by some other cowboy app which says “screw all that, gimme the data”. Any considerations that may have been given to concerns such as caching and application-level security go out of the window. The potential for locks and even deadlocks on the shared database is increased.\nIf you have the smallest shred of dignity and self-respect on behalf of your application, then please – don’t let its nether regions be exposed to all and sundry.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/enterprise-integration-anti-patterns-1-the-shared-database/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo, I was in the office at a client site, walking back to my desk after grabbing a quick coffee, when a developer on a sister product to my current project grabbed me and asked (I paraphrase somewhat):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Ian – [my app] needs to retrieve [small piece of data] from [your app], so I’ve stuck a stored proc in [your database], OK?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt quite violated.

What gives? The model has definitely been updated (as reflected in the literal which is now showing 2), but the textbox is still stubbornly displaying 1.\nWhat’s happening is that the Html helpers for form fields (including hidden fields) take their values from the controller’s ModelState dictionary, which contains details of all the POSTed fields and any validation errors.\nSo how to achieve our desired behaviour? We could make a quick and dirty call to ModelState.Clear(), but that’s not such a good idea and might lead to undesirable results surrounding validation.\nIn fact, this gotcha is symptomatic of a deeper anti-pattern in evidence in this example, namely rendering views from POST actions. Consider what happens if the user refreshes their browser when viewing the POSTed view. Recognise these dialog boxes?\nPretty ugly, aren’t they? And you really don’t want to leave open the possibility of a user accidentally submitting duplicate transactions if at all possible.\nEnter the Post, Redirect, Get pattern. Here, the POST action updates the model as before, but redirects to the GET action to perform the re-rendering of the view. Of course, you’ll need to persist the model somewhere in the meantime (e.g. session state). This pattern avoids the gotcha of a value from the ModelState being displayed instead of an updated figure, and ensures that your user will never see those ugly form resubmission dialog boxes, or submit duplicate transactions.\nHere’s a quick reworking of the earlier controller to use this pattern. Note the introduction of a “New” action to handle the instantiation of a new Foo instance. This is crummy code fraught with potential uncaught NullReferenceExceptions, but you’ll get the gist, I’m sure.\nAnd now we get the desired results on postback:\nIf you’re using MVC, and returning ViewResults from POST actions, I would urge you to consider the potential side-effects of that approach, and standardise instead on a PRG pattern.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/an-mvc-gotcha-and-the-prg-pattern/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you’ve recently moved across to ASP.NET MVC development following years of wrangling with the leaky abstraction that was WebForms, you may have encountered some seemingly curious behaviour when posting back to the same URL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppose we have the following simple, contrived and utterly imagination-free model:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere’s a view:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd here’s the controller:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote that we have two separate Index actions – one for HTTP GET which instantiates and displays a new FooModel instance, and one for HTTP POST which modifies one of the properties on the posted FooModel instance before re-rendering the view.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"An MVC Gotcha and the PRG Pattern"},{"content":"This blog post comes to you live from a Starbucks in the north of England.\nYesterday I wrapped up another eight months’ stint contracting at my old haunt Marshalls Plc.

I steeled myself to defend my work as he continued to explain:\n“Well, when coding we have to consider all the potential edge cases and exceptions – what happens if our methods get dodgy inputs etcetera. And it’s spilling over into my real life. We’re moving house at the moment, and I just find myself worrying about what happens if the buyers pull out, if we can’t get the mortgage, if the survey reveals problems… I’m really negative about the whole process.”\nAt the time I smiled and put this down to the notoriously tortuous British house-buying process, but the more I think about it, the more I think Scott might be onto something.\nMy wife and I are currently plotting a well-deserved summer vacation in sunnier climes, which theoretically should be an enjoyable task, right? But I can’t simply enjoy it and focus on the “sunny-day scenario”. My mind is full of edge cases (“What if we can’t fit all our stuff in the car?”), unhandled exceptions (“Will we get our passports in time?”), compatibility issues (“will our choice of dates suit my clients?”), unwise over-reliance on dependent components (“Will the airline have any child seats available?”) and of course user errors (“Suppose we book the wrong dates?!”). No focusing on the happy path for this codemonkey.\nThe more I think about it, the more I see that Scott has a point. Professional software development forces us to anticipate invalid input, stupid users, hackers, insufficient hardware, unreachable remote services, and whether our software can pass the Turkey test. We consider SQL injection, cross-site scripting, buffer overflows, and countless other common threats and exploits. Not to mention worrying about what happens when other devs get their grubby mitts on our codebase, or when the client inevitably unleashes some game-changing requirements late in the lifecycle. We’re all about expecting the worse, coding defensively, and decoupling ourselves from dependencies. The ever-present potential for high-profile failures caused by something as simple as an inverted boolean comparison, combined with the likelihood of critique and criticism from our fellow coders, DBAs, auditors and sysadmins is enough to turn most devs into a nervous wreck before they’ve so much as initialised a variable. That reminds me, I must check that my Professional Indemnity insurance policy is up to date.\nSo, anecdotal evidence and my own experience suggests to me that Border’s First Law is a truism. Programming Computers Can Cause Negativity, Cynicism and Pessimism.\nAre these necessarily negative traits to have, or can such enforced forethought and consideration of potential issues be a benefit in “real life”, away from the screen? I suspect as with many things, the answer is that there is some balance to be had. So – getting to the airport on time is A Good Thing. Spending a fortnight’s vacation panicking on the offchance that the flight operator goes bust is, probabilistically, a bit silly.\nI’m not sure where I’m going with this, or what the answer is, except perhaps to be a little more aware of this mindset and try to adopt a little restrain when applying programming principles to “real-life” conversations. Life, alas, is not a well-defined algorithm, and God knows it doesn’t come complete with a full suite of regression tests.\nPS – You know, I just remembered that I blogged about this topic before!\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/on-the-inherent-negativity-of-computer-programmers/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA couple of weeks ago, early one morning, my friend and fellow coder Scott asked a curious question:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think that programming computers for a living gives you a negative outlook on life?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Scott is unfortunately responsible for administering occasional TLC to a codebase that I cut as long ago as 2004, so I assumed he was referring to this and was about to raise some complaints about my hand-rolled query object criteria framework or other coding horror.

I am enamoured with the Castle Windsor project because its power makes it fairly simple for me to develop loosely-coupled systems which are easily maintained and tested. The wide range of Facilities and Contrib projects also integrate nicely with the other parts of my current development stack (NHibernate, WCF, WF, log4net).\nWhilst there is a lot of material on the web about the Dependency Injection capabilities of Windsor, the Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) features don’t seem to get as much exposure, so I thought I’d quickly blog about one way in which I’ve been making use of those in the system I’m currently developing.\nEarlier this year Davy Brion posted an excellent C# implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern described in Michael Nygard’s equally excellent book Release It! Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software.\nFor the uninitiated, this pattern advocates protecting your system from issues affecting any remote service on which it depends by wrapping your calls to that service with a circuit breaker component. This component notes any failed service invocations, until some threshold is reached, causing the circuit to trip. Subsequent attempted service invocations then “fail fast”, throwing a custom exception rather than passing the method call on to the remote service. This benefits your system, as it prevents you from tying up valuable threads creating expensive remote service calls which may be slow to timeout. And it benefits the remote system as you avoid piling further pressure on a service which is already down or unresponsive.\nFor more details of this pattern, and some entertaining war stories of situations in which they would have proved useful, I encourage you to read Michael Nygard’s book.\nNow, I like Davy’s implementation of this pattern a lot, particularly since it is implemented as an interceptor for Castle Windsor, which as mentioned I’m already making heavy use of in my current projects. But my only concern is that it is configured to trip after the number of failed invocations reaches a specific figure, irrespective of how long it takes to reach that threshold. I want an implementation which is able to sense the difference between infrequent exceptions over a prolonged period, and a sudden flurry of exceptions – the latter causing the circuit breaker to trip.\nTo achieve this I’ve tweaked Davy’s implementation slightly by adding an extra parameter to the constructor specifying the historical period over which to total the number of exceptions. That is, you can configure it such that a certain number of failures within the preceding y minutes causes the circuit breaker to trip.\nMy forked version can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/ianfnelson/CircuitBreaker.\nI look forward to seeing what adverts Google sees fit to stick at the bottom of this post… 🙂\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/a-circuit-breaker-which-trips-on-frequency-of-failures/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/jeremypearson\"\u003e@Jez\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/jeremypearson/statuses/5186129382\"\u003etweeted\u003c/a\u003e last night:\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\n\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\n\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny, but not true.

So, every time I asked Windsor for an IFooRepository, it supplied me with exactly the same concrete instance of FooRepository. Which would have been fine if it weren’t for the fact that FooRepository happened to indirectly hold a private reference to a thread-afine NHibernate session context. Ouchy.\nThe system I’m developing is a WCF service, and I’m using a Unit of Work pattern to open an NH session before the operation is invoked, and close it afterwards. To make this work, I simply needed to make sure that FooRepository (and any Castle-fulfilled component which has an IFooRepository dependency) has a transient lifestyle. Indeed, on further reflection, for most of the systems I develop, the transient lifestyles should be my default choice, and I do wonder why the Windsor developers chose to make singleton the default.\nDavy Brion has more info on this topic in this blog post – Windsor and Component Instance Lifetimes.\nSo, moral of the story – understand how your IoC container is fulfilling your requests, and be prepared to specify non-default behaviours if necessary.

One of its major benefits is that it abstracts away much of the drudgery of writing data access code from the developer, but as an unfortunate side effect of this it can make it easy to create inefficient data access layers.\nNHProf aims to reduce this risk by providing:\n“Cognitive application awareness.\nVisual insight into the interaction between your database and application code.\nAnalysis and detection of common pitfalls when using NHibernate.”\nSounds good, doesn’t it? So what does that mean in practice?\nHere’s a screenshot of the release candidate. Note that the Session Factory Statistics functionality is disabled in the current build.\nEach profiled NHibernate session can be selected individually from the pane in the top left, and from there we can drill down to see the details of each SQL statement executed against the database (formatted in nice readable manner), along with details of any parameters, and even an option of viewing the rows resulting from the statement.\nThe statements are interpreted, and suggestions and warnings are flagged as alerts, along with hyperlinks to online guidance explaining how the data access can be improved.\nA stack trace is also provided for each statement, allowing us to identify the code that caused the data access to occur. It’s possible to double-click on a row within this trace to jump straight to the code in Visual Studio.\nIn addition to showing the SQL statements executed by each session, details of the entities loaded by each session are also given.\n…and there’s a summary of the NHibernate usage for each session.\nAs well as providing session-by-session detail of what’s happening, NHProf allows us to analyse the overall activity. Here, I’m looking at unique queries containing the string “study” (note that differing parameters don’t count towards “uniqueness”):\nWe can also obtain analysis by Method, Url (for web applications) and Overall Usage statistics:\nIn my opinion NHProf has the potential to become an essential tool when creating or maintaining a solution which leverages the power of NHibernate. In addition to highlighting performance and other issues, it is a great aid when learning about NHibernate, or when familiarising oneself with an inherited solution. Overall, it’s the next best thing to having Ayende sat by your side lending a guiding hand.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/nhprof-nhibernate-profiler/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe inimitable \u003ca href=\"http://www.ayende.com\"\u003eAyende Rahien\u003c/a\u003e is close to releasing version 1.0 of his \u003ca href=\"http://www.nhprof.com\"\u003eNHibernate Profiler\u003c/a\u003e tool, and it really is shaping up to be a rather lovely little addition to my developer toolbox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn much the same way that we can use \u003ca href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181091.aspx\"\u003eSQL Server Profiler\u003c/a\u003e to monitor database activity, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.red-gate.com/products/ants_performance_profiler/\"\u003eANTS Profiler\u003c/a\u003e to monitor the performance and memory usage of .NET applications, NHProf profiles the activity of the data access layer (\u003ca href=\"http://nhforge.org\"\u003eNHibernate\u003c/a\u003e), and even goes as far as providing helpful hints for potential improvements.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"NHProf – NHibernate Profiler"},{"content":"There are many things I love about Team Foundation Server, but the supplied diff/merge tool is not one of them.

So, here goes. Inevitably, this is all from my perspective, though as Jocelyn’s side of things seemed to consist mostly of agonized screams and wailings, perhaps those aren’t the kind of details you want to hear anyway.\nCall #1 – It Begins I was working in Leeds on Tuesday. The first inkling I got that something was about to happen was a phone call from Jocelyn at 14:10. She told me that she was experiencing pains of a largely indeterminate nature, but not to bother coming home from work at that stage, as it might be nothing. Fair enough. Apparently she had been out to aqua natal that morning, then run some errands, and had only just put Ben down for a nap and started to think about what the pains might be. The conversation lasted 2 minutes 6 seconds, and I went back to my work.\nCall #2 – Come Home The second phone call came at 14:50. It was just 17 seconds long:\n“Hi Ian. So, these pains don’t seem to be going away.”\n“You want me to come home?”\n“Mmmmm, yeah – I think you’d better. Can you make the 3:15 train?”\n“If I run. Speak to you soon.”\nAs I arrived at the station, I wondered whether I should pick up a copy of the day’s newspaper, for posterity in case the baby should be born that day. In all honesty I thought it a remote possibility, but bought a copy of The Times anyway, reasoning that at least it would be something to read on the train home.\nAs it happened, on the platform I bumped into Ruth, mother of one of Ben’s pals, so I had some company and conversation for the journey. That evening Ruth posted a comment on my Facebook page saying “Talk about cool, calm \u0026amp; collected. You were more in control than me when I saw you this afternoon!!!”. This is true – Ruth had something of an “eeek!” expression on her face for most of the train ride. I, meanwhile, anticipated many hours of agonizing (and for me, boring) labour ahead before any real excitement (little did I know!), so I avoided Ruth’s panicked gaze by tweeting.\nThe train pulled into South Milford at around 15:45, and Jocelyn was there to pick me up (she’d waited for a contraction to pass before making the short journey to the station!)\nCall #3 – Summoning Backup Before we could think about heading to the hospital, we needed someone to look after Benjamin. Fortunately my mum had been on standby for this task for several weeks, denying herself her usual daily allowance of wine in preparedness. I placed the call around 16:00:\n“Mum, we need you please. Joce is in labour.”\n“Oh. But I have a pot of chutney on the hob. Hmmm. How urgent is it?”\n“Contractions about 10 minutes apart.”\n“Oh. Well. I’m just going to have to leave the chutney, aren’t I?”\n“Yep, I’m afraid so.”\nMums, don’tcha love their sense of priority? 😉\nAs we waited for backup to arrive, Jocelyn started pacing around the house in the way only a woman in labour possibly can. Benny thought this was hilarious, and walked behind his mother, playing “Follow the Leader”. I’m not entirely certain how much this helped Jocelyn’s situation – by this time most of the sounds emanating from her mouth were primeval groans. I just kept out of the way, and tweeted again.\nCall #4 – We’re Coming In When my mum arrived at ours around 17:00, I instinctively went to make her a cup of tea, and a drink for myself. It was at this point that the pacing, grunting, Jocelyn, stopped holding everything in and found her voice again.\n“Call the hospital. Call the hospital. Need to go in,” she said, stabbing a forefinger at her green NHS notes. I did as I was told.\n“Hello, my wife is in labour, and we’d like to come in, please,” I politely told the lady who answered the maternity ward phone.\n“Well, you’re very direct and straight to the point!” she curtly replied. I hadn’t realised that I would be expected to make small talk. “Can I at least have some details?”\nAfter providing the details requested (including “can I have a number beginning with ‘D’” – what kind of number begins with ‘D’ I wondered? Hexadecimal? I decided not to pursue that discussion at the present) she asked to speak to Jocelyn. I don’t know what they talked about – Joce just said “yes” three or four times, then put the phone down and told me we were to go to the hospital immediately. I was a tad disappointed that I wouldn’t be able to drink the cup of coffee that I’d just made myself, but thought it wise to keep this thought to myself, too.\nCall #5 – 999 Google maps tells me that the 17.3 mile journey from our home to York District Hospital takes around 33 minutes. It’s strange, in my head I always think of it as being much shorter, I don’t know why. On this particular day, travelling at rush hour, it would have taken us even longer, due to heavy traffic and road works.\nBy the time we were just a couple of miles from home, Jocelyn was screaming almost continually. Glancing at my watch as I drove, I timed the contractions to be three minutes apart, then reasoned with myself that I must have made a mistake and forgotten the original location of the minute hand – surely eight minutes would be more appropriate at this stage? But then the subsequent contraction came another three minutes hence, leaving lit\ntle doubt. I didn’t share these timings with Jocelyn, but I’m sure she was well aware of the immediacy of the situation.\nMy heart sank when we reached the A64 to find the eastbound carriageway moving at a snail’s pace. We trundled along for a mile or so, before Jocelyn spoke the truism that I’d not dared admit to myself:\n“We’re not going to make it to the hospital. You’re going to have to call 999.”\nNow, I’ve never had cause to phone 999 before. I had flashbacks to primary school assemblies wherein visiting police constables soberly explained the problems caused by hoax calls, and made it crystal clear that we should only think about dialling 999 if we were on the verge of death itself, lest we would surely go to hell, or at the very least be grounded for a good few weeks. These sessions obviously had a big influence on me, and I briefly hypothesised about an alternative solution to our problem, such as trying to force a route between the two lanes of near-stationary traffic. Jocelyn’s response came in the form of another anguished scream, and at 17:31 I placed the call. Mercifully my mobile had a charge, a signal, and Windows Mobile 6.1 hadn’t decided to crash when I wasn’t looking. Here’s how the conversation began:\n“Emergency, which service please?”\n“Ambulance.”\n“Ambulance, can you tell me the number you’re calling from?”\n“07901 828483”\n“What’s the address to which you need an ambulance sent?”\n“I’m travelling eastbound on the A64, east of Tadcaster. My wife is in labour, we’re trying to reach York hospital but we’re not going to get there in time.”\n“OK. I need to figure out exactly where you are. Have you gone over the river?”\n“Er, I’m not sure”. I wasn’t certain to which river she was referring (Ouse, Foss, Wharf?) and I couldn’t remember which was which anyway, so it seemed futile asking.\n“Is there a lay-by or somewhere you can pull off the road and park?”\n“Er… yes, we’re coming up to a small exit road now. Signed to Catterton and Healaugh.”\nAt this stage I was now glad that I’d made the call. The patient, calm lady on the other end of the phone told me to get off the A64, stop the car, put my hazards on, and await the assistance which was on the way. I used the “Where Am I?” TomTom functionality to confirm my location, and confirmed the colour and make of our vehicle. Then the operator told me I should “prepare and reassure my wife”. I think my efforts in respect of this task resulted in an epic fail.\nCavalry {#cavalry} After 9 minutes and 34 seconds the cavalry arrived, in the form of a down-to-earth Yorkshire chap in an ambulance responder vehicle. His initial words, on handing Jocelyn some nitrous oxide, were “There you go love, cop a load of that. Suck it in, there’s plenty!”. On being told that Jocelyn’s waters hadn’t broken, and nor was there any sign of a head, he frowned in my general direction, seemingly giving the impression that we were wasting his time, and I felt certain that he would dob me in to Mrs Lound, my primary school head teacher.\n“Weren’t you listening during assembly, Ian?” I envisaged her asking me sternly, as she proceeded to instruct me, a grown man of 33, to stand on the naughty steps of a school building that had long since been demolished.\nThen he glanced at his watch for a second time, and it seemed to dawn on him that, broken waters or not, contractions of only a minute apart indicate an imminent birth. He confirmed with the disembodied voices on his radio that an ambulance was on its way, before glancing up and down the length of our shiny Toyota Verso.\n“What reg’ is this?” he asked me.\n“Too new!” I shouted back, and he grinned back at me.\n“We’d better get an ambulance then, hadn’t we?” he replied.\nThe ambulance duly arrived, and Jocelyn was transferred into it. I abandoned the Verso and joined her. The all-female crew, Jo and Jo, told us that the plan was to try to reach York Hospital. Being safety-conscious ladies, they instructed me to sit down and put a seatbelt on, leaving me unable to offer much support over and above shouted encouragements and gripping Jocelyn’s ankle supportively. Not for the first time that evening, I began to think that I probably wasn’t helping much.\nWe’d only got a mile or so down the A64 before another blood-curdling cry and waters breaking all over the ambulance caused the crew to abandon all plans of reaching York Hospital in favour of delivering the baby at the side of the road, near to the services at Bilbrough top. From this point on, everything happened in double-quick time, and Isla Grace came into the world at 18:09.\nWe later learned that Isla was only the second baby that Jo and Jo had delivered in nine years of manning an ambulance. I wouldn’t have guessed; they seemed to know exactly what they were doing, and exuded an air of professionalism at all times. I was so thankful that we’d called the emergency services. Everyone grumbles occasionally about the enormous tax burden of the NHS, but there’s no denying that, in one’s hour of need, they really come through. God bless the Yorkshire Ambulance NHS Trust.\nThe high quality service continued as Isla and I transferred into a second ambulance whilst Jocelyn travelled ahead in the original vehicle. After checkups and a few stitches, Jocelyn was discharged from hospital later that evening. I took a £30 taxi ride to recover the Verso, we popped into a McDonald’s drive-thru for our supper, and we were all home and safely tucked up in bed by midnight.\nIt’s not an experience any of us want to relive, but as the bard said, All’s Well That Ends Well. And it’s a great story to tell Isla in a few years time.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/isla-grace-nelson/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt gives me the utmost pleasure to announce the birth of Miss Isla Grace Nelson.\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e \u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing a ludicrously speedy labour, Isla entered the world in an ambulance on the \u003ca href=\"http://maps.google.co.uk/?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;ll=53.907916,-1.18456\u0026amp;spn=0.00273,0.006673\u0026amp;z=17\"\u003eeastbound A64 near Bilbrough services\u003c/a\u003e on Tuesday 28th April at 18:09 local time (\u003ca href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=28\u0026amp;month=4\u0026amp;year=2009\u0026amp;hour=18\u0026amp;min=9\u0026amp;sec=0\u0026amp;p1=136\"\u003esee this time in your time zone\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer birth mass was 3.750 kilograms (8 pounds 4 ounces), and length was 50 centimetres (20 inches).\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Isla Grace Nelson"},{"content":"I spent much of this weekend over in Bradford, talking shop with the good folks at the Alt.Net UK ‘in the North’ conference. I had a great time, learned much, and am grateful to Richard Fennell of Black Marble and the other organisers and sponsors for making the event possible.\nThis was the first Open Spaces event I’ve attended, and I was pleasantly surprised at how orderly and productive the sessions turned out to be. Unlike conventional sales-pitch conferences of the MSDN roadshow variety, this was more of an open forum, with an expectation that all of the relatively small number (25ish?) of participants would, well, participate!\nI was also surprised to find that there were more pragmatists in attendance than architecture astronauts. Maybe it’s a reflection of the current economic climate, but a common theme was on finding toolings that were good enough with which to deliver suitable solutions quickly and effectively, rather than striving for architectural purity and perfection.\nIt was great to hear some war stories, and learn about technologies, tools, methodologies and ideas that are currently exciting other people. It would be difficult to come away from a weekend like this one without some inspiration and a big list of several things to follow up on. Here’s mine:\nMVC Framework – like myself, a lot of the attendees have had enough of the WebForms model, and are excited about the potential of ASP.NET MVC. Fluent NHibernate – it sounds like the project being feverishly worked on by James Gregory et al is ready for prime time. People spoke very positively of the ability to ditch XML HBM files in favour of this strongly-typed configuration. Balsamiq Mockups – loved by everyone, even despite (or should that be because of?) its use of Comic Sans MS! Inversion of Control – there was a wide mix of IoC containers being used. I’ve tried Castle Windsor, other people made positive murmurings about Unity and StructureMap. TypeMock Isolator – apparently capable of mocking the unmockable. Sketching User Experiences – everyone who’d heard of him spoke highly of Bill Buxton’s work. Open Quarters CMS – a great demonstration of a CMS built on ASP.NET MVC by Anthony Main and Andrew Magee. I look forward to taking a squizz at the source, I’m sure it will be an excellent learning aid. SWAT – a web testing tool developed by some folks at Ultimate Software and released on Sourceforge as an open source project (thanks to Nick for the link). Wild Blue Yonder – a delicious amber ale from Oregon which was on tap at the Sir Titus Salt pub, to where we decamped after the planning session on Friday night. Yum!

It also seems that no amount of evangelism or proselytism from freelancers such as myself is likely to change the situation any time soon – it’s just the organisational culture. To be realistic, there comes a point in time at which I have to accept that fact, shut up, and knuckle down to achieving the project deliverables in the manner requested by the client. The customer is always right, as they say.\nAs I bide my time looking for some new clients who share my development methodology ideologies, I’ve been trying to retain some semblance of sanity by keeping on top of agile techniques and technologies, and by seeking kindred spirits with whom to discuss the same. I was pleasantly surprised to discover the existence of the Agile Yorkshire Club, who meet monthly in the back room of a pub in Leeds. So I pitched up last Wednesday, enjoyed the free beer, met some friendly and seemingly like-minded people, and listened to an interesting session by Richard Fennell of Black Marble as he talked about Alistair Cockburn’s Crystal Clear methodology, which seemed to me to be essentially “Pragmatic SCRUM”.\nI’ve often heard people say that it’s a good idea to get involved with a local user group, or attend community events, and now I’m starting to appreciate why. In addition to the mind-broadening opportunities, the networking potential for freelancers is also an obvious benefit.

The development process for this framework has been very transparent, with no fewer than eight previews, betas and release candidates made available over the past year or so.\nMicrosoft are being careful to tout ASP.NET MVC as being “an alternative, not a replacement, for ASP.NET Web Forms”, but just look at their list of some of its benefits:\nClear separation of concerns Testability – support for Test-Driven Development Fine-grained control over HTML and JavaScript Intuitive URLs Which begs the question – if you were kicking off development of a new web-based application on the Microsoft platform today, why would you even consider using Web Forms? Surely the choice now boils down to Silverlight or ASP.NET MVC? I fully expect that, by the time the summer Olympics come to London, Web Forms will be considered to be a legacy platform, with job adverts referring to it as “Classic ASP.NET”.\nAnd that’s probably no bad thing. Sure, for those of us who lived through the static web, CGI forms and classic ASP, ASP.NET was a godsend, with its cunning state management techniques, custom controls, and page lifecycle events. But, even in the hands of decent developers, it does tend to promote a magic pushbutton anti-pattern, with untestable business logic frequently dumped in the code-behind. So, as a fanboy of OOP, TDD, and Separation of Concerns, this eventual release of ASP.NET MVC comes as a source of great pleasure to me, and means that I can look forward to many more years of enjoyably developing web apps on the MS platform.\nBut hang on a cotton-picking minute – what exactly is truly new, here? Haven’t we been able to do MVC development on the MS platform for years, using Castle Monorail? Well, yes we have – I had the pleasure of using it last summer when developing systems for Child Maintenance Options. And Monorail itself was inspired by Ruby on Rails, and the J2EE platform has had Apache Struts for donkey’s years (I used it briefly in the summer of 2002 when developing systems for Three).\nSo, if we could do this stuff already, even on the ASP.NET platform, why does the release of ASP.NET MVC still matter so much?\nThe slightly depressing but inevitable truth is that it matters because it’s a product which has been developed by and will be fully supported by Microsoft. To many organisations, that’s reason enough to use it when they would have never in a month of Sundays considered using the likes of Monorail.\nAs a crude indicator of popularity, consider the questions posted on Stack Overflow to date. 1819 of them have been tagged “ASP.NET-MVC”, whilst a mere 22 have been tagged “Monorail” or “Castle-Monorail”.\nThe same can be seen of many other modern technologies used in the development of custom applications. Take ORM for example – NHibernate has been around for, what, around six years or so since it was originally ported from Hibernate (I seem to have first mentioned it on this blog in 2004). But the traction that LINQ to SQL and Entity Framework have garnered in their short existence has already almost outstripped the popularity of NHibernate by some metrics.\nEntity Framework, while not to everyone’s taste, at least has the potential to offer something quite different and distinct from NHibernate. But the same can’t be said of some other recent examples of Microsoft’s ongoing Embrace, Extend and Extinguish policy – what does Visual Studio Unit Testing offer that NUnit didn’t? Why develop the Unity Application Block in a universe that already contains Castle Windsor and a plethora of other IoC containers? How long will it be before Microsoft write their own mock object framework? Surely they will eventually do so, to meet the demands of the large proportion of dev shops that simply won’t touch none-MS tooling.\nWhy this should be the case, I can’t really say, but as a freelance developer I’ve seen it with my own eyes – working with organisations with technical strategies that specify the use of Microsoft technologies wherever possible, and shun the adoption of open source or third-party solutions. I hear people say “we’ll wait for Entity Framework to mature, rather than trying NHibernate”, and I see the funny stares people give me when I meekly suggest that we use xUnit.Net or Moq on a project.\nSo, perhaps we can’t entirely blame Microsoft. True, their practices do sometimes feel to be anti-competitive and limiting of choice. But they are a business after all, and are merely meeting the demands of their customers.\nAnd is it really in my best interests to complain about these practices? I am a freelance developer and Microsoft registered partner and have to be pragmatic about this. I am in business developing custom applications for the Microsoft platform, and in doing so I want to use 21st-century techniques such as ORM, the MVC pattern, unit testing, mocking, IoC, etc. If my clients are more likely to be receptive to those concepts if there exists a suitable Microsoft implementation, then so be it. But please, let me continue using NHibernate instead of Entity Framework…\nASP.NET RIP.

Personally, I can’t imagine coding without first installing Refactor Pro, editing text files in anything other than TextPad, or working on a machine that doesn’t have Snag It installed.\nMRI For Your .NET Application Another one of the tools that I reach for frequently, and the subject of this blog post, is NDepend, which performs rapid static analysis of a set of .NET assemblies and provides a deliciously visual interface for interpreting and understanding the results. Through the use of this tool, architects and developers can quickly spot problems or potential areas for improvements in a codebase. It’s essentially an MRI Scanner for your .NET code!\nSo.. What Does It Do? I’ve briefly mentioned my use of NDepend before – for example I blogged in December about how I was able to use NDepend to resolve an MSB3247 compiler warning which a developer was experiencing. But there’s much more to it than just helping solve simple assembly reference problems. Some of my favourite features include:\nAn interactive Dependency Graph, giving a visual representation of the relationships between assemblies (both within your application, and any third-party and system dependencies). Here’s an example output from analysing the S#arp Architecture project:\nThe Dependency Matrix cross-tabulates all the references between assemblies, allowing for drilling down to member level. Remember all those dictats you issued to the dev team in your coding standards, such as “don’t reference the data layer from the front-end”? Well, this is the window you’ll use for ensuring that the team are abiding by such rules. Usefully, cyclical references between namespaces are particularly highlighted.\nThe Metrics Window is where I tend to spend most of my time, using the inbuilt CQL (Code Query Language) to identify areas of the codebase which are ripe for refactoring. This area of the tool is like FxCop on steroids.\nI’m also a big fan of the Changes Explorer functionality, which highlights at a glance the changes made between any two builds of an application. Also the ability to import Code Coverage files from NCover or Visual Studio Team System, to similarly highlight the areas of a solution which are adequately covered by unit tests.\nReal-World Benefits NDepend is useful when looking at your own code, but really comes into its own when you want to quickly grok a codebase developed by someone else. Here’s an example:\nMy current client have the IP rights to a bespoke .NET application which has been developed for them by a third party. They plan to bring the development of this application in house, and recently asked me to take a look through the source and feed back my thoughts on the architecture.\nInitially, I made the mistake of doing this code review solely by looking at the code itself, through the IDE. I was impressed – the code was exceedingly clean, the solution well-structured, and everything looked very straightforward. The object model was mapped to the database using NHibernate, which in turn was abstracted from the appliation code by a standard DAO pattern. So far so good, and I was about to email a thumbs-up.\nBut I smelled a rat – the code was almost too clean, and I couldn’t find the actual meat of the business logic. So, I whipped out NDepend (which I really should have done initially), ran an analysis, and realised that the cleanliness and simplicity of the middle tier was due to over two-thirds of the solution logic existing in the user interface layer! In fact 28% of the IL instructions from the entire solution were contained in the code-behind of just three web pages. It was a classic example of the magic pushbutton anti-pattern, and I very nearly failed to spot it.\nTMI? If I had to identify a drawback to NDepend, it is the risk that much of the output information may be meaningless to the average .NET developer. Returning to my earlier medical analogies, an X-Ray or MRI Scan is useless in itself until it is viewed by a medical professional with the knowledge and experience to interpret the results.\nThis potential problem is somewhat alleviated by the explanatory videos, Patrick’s extensive blogging, and indeed the range of predefined CQL queries which serve to interpret the results and highlight potential problems. Even so, I suspect NDepend is more likely to be found in the toolkit of the architect or lead developer rather than the hobbyist – especially given the EUR 299 price tag for a professional license.\nFinal Thoughts To summarise, NDepend provides a short-cut to quickly understanding a .NET codebase and identifying potential improvements. If the quality of your code is important to you, or you frequently have to review code developed by other people, then I think you’ll find NDepend to be indispensable.\nDisclaimer: Ian Nelson was provided with a complementary review copy of NDepend Professional version 2.0, and has subsequently paid for later editions of the software.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/ndepend/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOK, dear readers, today I’d like to talk about tools.\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e \u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoftware development isn’t really so different from traditional skilled crafts in that it is important to have an understanding of the tools available to help you create a quality products in the least amount of time possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor .NET developers, the Visual Studio IDE is usually just the starting point, and most of us will come to rely on some of the tools listed in Scott Hanselman’s famous \u003ca href=\"http://www.hanselman.com/tools\"\u003etools list\u003c/a\u003e.

Subjective. Not enforced. Largely copied from the interweb. Obsessed with the trivial (e.g. whitespace) while failing to mention the genuinely useful (e.g. boxing/unboxing, avoiding use of deprecated classes, Dispose pattern, etc). I know this because I’ve been involved in creating such documents in the past 🙂\nDon’t get me wrong, I’m all in favour of creating clean code, and promoting standards within a team. I just find that most in-house style guides fail to achieve this, for the reasons listed above.\nSo, as I was walking through the city today, I started having a little debate with myself. “OK then, smarty-pants. What’s your alternative? What would your in-house coding standards guidelines look like?”\nI think it can be summarised by four simple points, listed in order of importance:\n1. Don’t Ignore Compiler Warnings\nYou might think this would be an obvious one, but I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve retrieved a solution from source control, compiled it, and been presented with a list of compiler warnings. Most of the time, there’s no excuse for this. If the compiler smells a rat in your code, then you’ve got a problem, be it variables that are used without being initialized, unused variables, unreachable code, or whatever. It’s sloppy code, and it’s easily avoided, so don’t leave it for the next guy to clean up. I am, if you hadn’t guessed, a big fan of setting the “treat compiler warnings as errors” flag in a project’s build properties.\n2. Follow the Framework Design Guidelines\nThe Framework Design Guidelines is another one of those books whose name doesn’t do it justice. The sagely guidance it contains is appropriate not only to Microsofties developing the FCL itself, but to anyone writing any .NET code. Don’t let your developers near a copy of Visual Studio until they’ve provided a sworn affidavit confirming that they’ve read this book! 🙂\nAll of the guidelines are concisely boiled down into Do, Consider, Avoid, and Do Not recommendations, and you would do well to adhere to these. Getting a few copies of this book for your team is a much more effective and cost-effective approach than trying to develop your own coding standards.\n3. Run FxCop\nHaving read and digested the Framework Design Guidelines, you need an easy way to enforce them. This is best achieved by running FxCop against your code (now integrated into some of the Visual Studio SKUs as a “Code Analysis” option).\nDepending on the target audience for your solution, you may consider it reasonable to ignore some of the localization recommendations (i.e. when developing in-house line of business applications with limited geographical reach). But generally, if FxCop flags a warning in your code, I believe you would be well advised to correct the problem. Doing this helps to avoid a wide range of performance, security and design issues, in addition to enforcing consistent source code conventions.\n4. Run StyleCop\nFinally, if you simply must achieve that uniform source code appearance that the whitespace Nazis in every team strive for, consider requiring that your devs run their code through StyleCop before checking in. It may initially be a bit annoying, and for sure some of the recommendations are highly subjective, but there’s no arguing that it does enforce a standard style, with a strong focus on increasing readability and reducing ambiguity.\nAnd After That…?\nFollowing the four points above should result in the low-level codebase produced by a team being readable, of high quality, in a common style, and free of many common “gotchas”. It doesn’t validate the higher-level architectural considerations, but in my opinion that is outside the scope of such a document, and could best be achieved through the use of a tool such as NDepend.

If someone deletes any data from [application] front end is it possible to restore it? Generally the way to recover data would be to restore the database from a database backup file, however this would restore all data held in the backup and would overwrite any changes made since the time of the backup.”\nand\n“If user A corrupts data entry in some way, and needs to go back to a version X of the database before the corruption, will user B also have to go back to version X and potentially lose any ‘good’ they themselves might have added since version X?”\nI replied explaining that this is one of the many reasons for choosing SQL Server to provide the database back-end for critical applications, rather than, say, Access (don’t get me started on the prevalence of Access in mission-critical applications, it’s a bit of a bugbear).\nIf you have your SQL database recovery model set to Full or Bulk-Logged (and if not, why not?) then it is possible to restore from transaction log backups to a point in time. So, in a data loss scenario like those outlined in the emails above, you would take a backup of the transaction log, and restore a new copy of the database to a point in time just before the deletion. The missing data could then be copied from the restored copy across to the live database. Easy.\nEven so, just because this functionality exists doesn’t mean you should plan to use it. Flipping back to my system developer persona makes me question why the application allows users to perform non-logged hard deletes? Soft deletes would be far preferable (i.e. setting a “deleted” bit on the relevant rows). Better still are ledgering systems (like the bank statement paradigm), which handle updates and deletions by making a change entry, or entering an offsetting transaction.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/sql-server-point-in-time-restore/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOne of the multiple hats that I’m currently wearing for a client is that of SQL Server DBA.

Before setting off, I tried to make sure that all the prerequisites were in place – i.e. that there was a suitably-specced server available for use, which was connected to the domain, that all the necessary service accounts were created, and firewall ports opened, etc.\nSo, I kicked myself somewhat on arrival when I realised that the server was running a 64-bit OS, and remembered that the application tier of TFS only supports 32-bit. Doh! This blog entry is partly intended to prevent me from ever forgetting that again.\nHowever, it all turned out fine in the end. There were other reasons why I didn’t relish the prospect of installing TFS on the box in question – namely that it was also being used as a domain controller and SQL Server (this isn’t as bad as it sounds – the server exists solely to provide an R\u0026amp;D development environment for a new project with demanding timescales). So, the solution I opted for was to install Virtual Server 2005 R2, and then install TFS on a virtual machine running a 32-bit OS. This worked well, as the host server was massively over-specced for the tasks at hand.\nI think virtualization is a technology whose time has really come, it certainly makes it very easy to set up development environments like this one, where the number of servers required exceeds the number of physical servers available. Occasionally I come across posts on the web from people who’re trying to install, say, TFS, SQL Server, SharePoint, and Exchange all on the same server, and getting into a pickle. Don’t do it. Embrace virtualization. Developers know all about separation of concerns when designing software solutions – try the equivalent approach when configuring your development servers.\nAs an aside – the team chose to use Conchango’s SCRUM for Team System process template, which seems to work very well, and I recommend it for anyone running a project using the SCRUM methodology. Remember, TFS is process-agnostic, you’re not limited to using MSF.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/on-64-bit-tfs-virtualization-and-conchango-scrum/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eEarlier this week I picked up a hire car and headed over to deepest Cheshire to install an instance of Team Foundation Server 2008 for a client.

Heck, truth be told, I sometimes come across teams who don’t use source control, but that’s by the bye.\nIn these situations, I try my best to lead by example, continuing to practise TDD on any new code that I cut, and insisting on covering with unit tests any pre-existing code which I have to modify. Sooner or later, this prompts someone to ask why I am doing this (often insinuating that I am wasting my time, and by implication the client’s money). At that point, flustered, I invariably struggle to remember or adequately articulate the many and various ways in which unit testing makes me a better developer. So, consider this blog post a personal aide-mémoire to help me the next time this occurs (as well as being a homage to Jake Shillingford’s second-best song).\n1. I know that my code works.\nLet’s get the obvious one out of the way first. If I take the time to write unit tests for my code, then I know that the code “works” (i.e. that it behaves as I intended, or hopefully as the specification requested). Any time I want to check that my code works, I can do so with a few clicks. The confidence and feeling of well-being that this brings can’t be underestimated. If you don’t have unit tests, how do you know that your code works?\n2. I know when I’m finished.\nAs you’ll know if you’ve read my post professing my undying love for Remember The Milk, I’m fond of organising my life through to-do lists. When I’m developing software, the unit tests that I create before developing the code act as my to-do list, help me focus on what it is that I’m trying to achieve, without getting distracted making unrelated changes to the codebase. When all the tests go green, I know I’m done and can move on to the next task.\n3. I can develop cleaner APIs.\nI’m not much of a UI developer; I spend much more of my time working in the middle tier, making class libraries, object models, WCF services and the like. When practicing TDD, I write tests to consume my code before I write the code itself. This forces me to think about things like method signatures and member visibility. Should that method really be public? Do I really need that “out” parameter? Will all those overloads get used? If I didn’t write tests for the middle tier in this way, I wouldn’t consider these questions in quite so much detail, and these issues wouldn’t come to light until I (or worse, someone else), began consuming my code for real.\n4. Testable code is well-designed code.\nThis one came as an unexpected surprise to me after I had been writing unit tests for a while and forced myself to make the effort to test code which I initially felt was difficult to test.\nIt turns out that many of the techniques which can be used to make code more testable are the exact same techniques which make code better designed, understandable, flexible and maintainable.\nBe honest, when you’re cutting code, how often do you consider things like Low Coupling, High Cohesion, and adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle? Probably not often, I’ll bet. I know I didn’t. But since I started asking myself “How can I make this code testable?” I’ve been delighted to realise that my code magically acquired these properties as a pleasant side effect. Similarly, using techniques like Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control along with Mocking Frameworks for the purposes of testability also serves to make the solution more open to change, and reduces dependencies during the development process (no longer do you hear “Gee boss, I’d love to get started writing the Foo class, but it depends on the Bar class, and Dave hasn’t finished writing that, what with the accident with the bus and all…”).\n5. I can refactor mercilessly and fearlessly.\n“Nel-son!!”\nI like refactoring. No, wait, scrub that – I love refactoring. Some people get their kicks from gardening, well, I could spend many happy hours weeding a big tangled codebase. Now, in the past, this has gotten me into trouble, when the “improvements” I’ve rashly made have inadvertently caused bugs (sorry John, Sion, Scott and Colin!). Since adopting TDD however, I’ve been confident that my code is sufficiently covered by unit tests that I may refactor mercilessly, safe in the knowledge that the test suite will highlight any unintended side effects. This results in a winning combination of clean code and co-workers who don’t have an urge to throttle me.\n6. I Release Fewer Stupid Mistakes.\n“Ah, yeah, silly me, I just copied-and-pasted a line in the DAL, and now all your customers are displaying as having the same forename and surname! Smith Smith, Brown Brown, ha ha!”\nPerversely, some coders seem to wear their really dumb mistakes as a “badge of honour”, proof of their fallibility, a sign that they are human. It’s as if they are suggesting to their boss/client not to worry, that they only make dumb mistakes on the easy code, but concentrate much harder when coding the tough algorithms. Honest, guv’.\nI don’t buy this crap. Stupid mistakes are stupid mistakes, period. I think that dumb mistakes, uncaught at an early stage, waste the time of the test team, result in rework, and ultimately waste the client’s money. That’s nothing to laugh about. Covering even the simple, easy code with unit tests reduces the likelihood of these knucklehead bugs getting through, increasing my likelihood of a “right-first-time” reputation. And that’s something to be proud of.\n7. Bugs don’t come back.\n“But I’m sure we fixed that bug months ago!”\nBefore I fix a bug, I write a failing test. That test then becomes a permanent fixture in the test suite, and therefore I can be confident that no “undead bug” will ever come back to haunt me. It’s a very simple concept, but it works. Bug reactivations imply loose development practices, and that’s not an implication I want to be made about my work. Kill the bug once, and keep it dead.\n8. It’s the fastest way to test my changes.\nTesting my changes through artificial unit tests is invariably quicker than testing the functionality by calling it through “real life” use of the overall system.\nSuppose that I’m working on amended postage charge logic for an online retailer – I could test this by either:\na) Repeatedly manually walking through the application, adding a product to my basket, attempting to “check out”, and calculating whether the displayed postage charge is as I expect, or\nb) Writing a unit test once to automate the testing of the new logic.\nGee, let me think about that for a while…\n9. I spend more time coding, less time in the debugger.\nStop me if this conversation sound\ns at all familiar:\n“How was your day today, darling?”\n“Ugh, don’t ask. I spent, like, seven hours trying to track down a bug. I pulled out Reflector, and even started debugging into the .NET framework class library – I was convinced for a while there it was a problem in System.String. But it turned out I just had some Boolean logic the wrong way round.”\n“That’s nice, dear. More mange tout?”\nVisual Studio has excellent debugging tools, but still, I’d rather be spending my time cutting new code, thanks all the same. I’m sure the clients who pay my invoices feel much the same. Catching the bugs early, through effective unit testing, means that I spend far less time in the debugger.\n10. Writing documentation and sample code is boring.\nVisiting the dentist. Cleaning the bathroom. Writing documentation. All things which I’d rather put off until tomorrow, thank you very much.\nIf, on any given day, I have the choice between firing up Word and documenting my class library, or firing up Visual Studio and adding shiny new functionality to the same library, well, it’s no contest.\nBut here’s the neat thing – having taken the time to create a comprehensive suite of unit tests for my own, selfish purposes, it turns out that potential consumers of my library can benefit from them as a de facto set of usage examples and documentation. Yay!\n11. I can hand the code over to other people.\n“Dave’s the only person who understands that code.”\nOh really? What happens when Dave is on holiday? Or quits to get a better-paid job? Or gets hit by a bus? That’s a bit of a risk for your project, surely.\nMaybe you’re a Dave, and your unique knowledge of a particular system means that you only ever get to work on that one application. Shiny new projects come along, and get handed to your colleagues, because you’re too busy supporting the Legacy App From Hell, until you quit to get that better paid job, or walk in front of a bus in desperation.\nIf, on the other hand, you’ve covered the code in unit tests, then you have effectively documented the codebase, provided example usages, and made it near-impossible for any future developers to break existing functionality due to their ignorance of the system. They can try making a change, run the unit tests, and instantly find out whether their change works. This helps to make possible Collective Code Ownership, a variety of work for all members of the team, and no risky dependencies on Dave and his jaywalking habits.\n12. I’m A Professional\nI’ll return to what I said in the opening sentence of this article – this is professional software development. This isn’t just my hobby, or my day job. It’s my career, my business, my passion and the livelihood of myself and my family. I strive to improve and hopefully excel at it. All the research and my own experience suggests that practicing TDD results in fewer defects, saves time in the medium and long term, and is generally the approach to be expected of a professional. If you’re looking for a quick-fix from a cowboy contractor, go elsewhere and save yourself some money… in the short term 🙂\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/12-reasons-why-i-love-unit-tests/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOn my continuing journey through this thrilling world of professional software development, I frequently encounter teams who hold no truck with this crazy new-fangled concept of unit testing.

So I started looking for ways to improve my daily working environment.\nUnlike John, I can’t afford a Herman Miller chair, and even if I could, I’m a freelancer rather than a telecommuter* so I would have to regularly carry the chair on the train to client sites, where they would probably ostracise me for being a weirdo who brings his own chair to the office. So I looked for something a little more portable, and decided that perhaps it was finally time for me to try one of those fancy split ergonomic keyboards that I’ve always scoffed at. After reading a few review on Amazon, I plumped for the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000.\nI should probably mention at this point that I’ve never been formally taught to type, and I don’t touch-type in the traditional way, with fingers sticking loyally around the ASDF JKL: keys. I’ve been more of an autodidact, typing quickly but inefficiently, a few finger dancing crazily around the keys whilst the others (notably my pinkies) float lazily in the air, dreaming of the time they were once called upon to pull a wishbone or contribute to a clenched fist.\nThis means that initially, I found adjusting to the layout of the ergonomic keyboard quite tough – I was slowed down, and had to relearn the relative positions of the keys. For a week or so, I only used the new keyboard at home, as it would have been too slow and frustrating for workaday use. But gradually I grew accustomed to it, and found that I appreciated being able to rest my palms on the wrist-rest, with fingers dropping down towards the keys courtesy of the reverse slope.\nSo, I took a further plunge, and bought a second keyboard to take to the office. A few months more have passed, and now I can’t imagine using anything else on a daily basis. It really is more comfortable, and my shoulders and arms feel considerably more relaxed. I’m also back up to the kind of wpm that achieved on a standard keyboard.\nOther than the ergonomic design, the 4000 series boasts a few other features, some of which may appeal, depending on the kind of applications you frequently use:\nNotably, all the function keys have been relabelled with additional functionality such as Undo, Redo, New, Open, Close, Spell, Save and Print. Depending on your mentality you will either find this incredibly useful or incredibly annoying (if you’re in the latter camp then you’ll be pleased to know that ordinary service can be resumed thanks to an “F Lock” key.\nI am fond of the button which launches Calculator (one of my most often-launched applications), as well as the buttons to control volume and pause media player (which works fine with iTunes 7).\nI also appreciate the additional four buttons above the numeric keypad – putting an extra equals, parentheses and backspace where you’ll find them most useful when working with a spreadsheet or similar\nThere are also buttons to launch a web browser, email application, navigate to a search engine, open favourites, navigate back and forth, a zoom control, and five customisable buttons – but to be honest I haven’t made use of any of these. YMMV.\nSo, in summary – having got past those difficult early “getting to know you” dates, I now foresee a long and happy relationship with the 4000 series. And I’m sure my shoulders will be happy to hear that.\ndoes anybody say “telecommuter” these days?

After reading a few review on Amazon, I plumped for the \u003ca href=\"http://amzn.to/RPdDlW\"\u003eMicrosoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"A Keyboard Makes A Hell Of A Difference"},{"content":"Tobin blogged earlier this week about how quality ORM tools like NHibernate make it easier to code to normalized schemas.\nHere’s a corollary for you: The use of ORM tools doesn’t absolve the need to maintain good database design principles, and even NHibernate won’t save you from your own stupidity.\nFollowing an application upgrade release last night, I’ve spent a disproportionate amount of today trying to debug the following exception, which appeared to originate in an area of the codebase which I personally had heavily modified:\n_NHibernate.HibernateException: More than one row with the given identifier was found: 42806, for class: Cmec.Core.Domain.Customer\nat NHibernate.Loader.Entity.AbstractEntityLoader.Load(ISessionImplementor session, Object id, Object optionalObject, Object optionalId)\nat NHibernate.Loader.Entity.AbstractEntityLoader.Load(Object id, Object optionalObject, ISessionImplementor session)\nat NHibernate.Persister.Entity.AbstractEntityPersister.Load(Object id, Object optionalObject, LockMode lockMode, ISessionImplementor session)\nat NHibernate.Impl.SessionImpl.DoLoad(Type theClass, Object id, Object optionalObject, LockMode lockMode, Boolean checkDeleted)\nat NHibernate.Impl.SessionImpl.DoLoadByClass(Type clazz, Object id, Boolean checkDeleted, Boolean allowProxyCreation)\nat NHibernate.Impl.SessionImpl.InternalLoad(Type clazz, Object id, Boolean eager, Boolean isNullable)\nat NHibernate.Type.EntityType.ResolveIdentifier(Object id, ISessionImplementor session, Object owner)\nat NHibernate.Impl.SessionImpl.InitializeEntity(Object obj)\nat NHibernate.Loader.Loader.InitializeEntitiesAndCollections(IList hydratedObjects, Object resultSetId, ISessionImplementor session)\nat NHibernate.Loader.Loader.DoQuery(ISessionImplementor session, QueryParameters queryParameters, Boolean returnProxies)\nat NHibernate.Loader.Loader.DoQueryAndInitializeNonLazyCollections(ISessionImplementor session, QueryParameters queryParameters, Boolean returnProxies)\nat NHibernate.Loader.Loader.DoList(ISessionImplementor session, QueryParameters queryParameters)\nat NHibernate.Loader.Loader.List(ISessionImplementor session, QueryParameters queryParameters, ISet querySpaces, IType[] resultTypes)\nat NHibernate.Hql.Classic.QueryTranslator.List(ISessionImplementor session, QueryParameters queryParameters)\nat NHibernate.Impl.SessionImpl.Find(String query, QueryParameters parameters, IList results)\nat NHibernate.Impl.SessionImpl.Find[T](String query, QueryParameters parameters)\nat NHibernate.Impl.QueryImpl.List[T]()\nat Ventura.NHibernate.Data.DaoBase`2.GetByHql(String hql, String[] params)\nat Cmec.Data.CorrespondenceRequestDao.GetCorrespondenceExtractRequests()\nat Cmec.Core.Tasks.CorrespondenceExtractCreationTask.TaskProcess()\nat Cmec.Core.Tasks.BaseTask.PerformTask()\nat CmecService.CmecService._timer_Tick(Object state)\nGot that? NHibernate is telling me that it has found two customers on the database with the same surrogate primary key, which is obviously not the case.\nTrusting NHibernate as I do, and not generally being the kind of coder who assumes that the technology is to blame, I then spent literally hours digging through my amended code, trying to figure out what nonsense I could be trying to pull that was confusing NHibernate so, but found nothing.\nToo late in the day, I dusted down Occam’s trusty razor, and realised that whilst the main Customers table was correctly enforcing primary keys, I hadn’t checked the various child tables. Lo and behold, less than a minute later I found the following reference data in an innocuous looking table of referrers:\nRemoving the duplicated entry for “Other”, which was incorrectly using the same ID as “Website”, solved my problems instantly. And needless to say, I’ve made a note to go add a primary key to that table at the earliest opportunity.\nThe moral of this cautionary tale – using an ORM makes your life as an application developer easier, makes it faster to develop a DAL, and (to a large extent) decouples your application from your choice of database. What it doesn’t do is allow you to forget the tenets of good database design, in fact as Tobin points out it actually serves to encourage them.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/database-design-still-important-in-these-orm-obsessed-days/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.tobinharris.com/2008/7/28/is-or-m-is-encouraging-db-normalization\"\u003eTobin blogged earlier this week\u003c/a\u003e about how quality ORM tools like NHibernate make it easier to code to normalized schemas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere’s a corollary for you: The use of ORM tools doesn’t absolve the need to maintain good database design principles, and even NHibernate won’t save you from your own stupidity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing an application upgrade release last night, I’ve spent a disproportionate amount of today trying to debug the following exception, which appeared to originate in an area of the codebase which I personally had heavily modified:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Database Design – Still Important In These ORM-Obsessed Days"},{"content":"In response to a blog post that I’d shared in Google Reader, Jez emailed me to ask:\n“Do you use RTM?

I suppose you need to adopt it in tandem with the five-point GTD philosophy to get real benefit?”\nMy response:\n“Yes, I do use RTM, and I love it. I’ve been looking for a decent way of managing my to-do lists effectively for years, and RTM really scratches that itch! I now have the web app permanently open in a Firefox tab, and use “MilkSync” to synchronize with my Pocket PC every half hour.\nI’m not sure that you need to adopt a particular task-management philosophy in order to get benefit – RTM is flexible enough to allow you to work the way you want to. I started off pretty basic, with just three lists, one each for personal, business, and current client tasks. But recently (having read that article and re-read the relevant bits of GTD), I have begun using tags and locations and using these to get the benefit of some smart lists. So, I’m currently on the train to work, and I can look at my “@Train” list and see at a glance the stuff tagged with “na” (for “next actions”) and a location of @Train – i.e the stuff that I can and should be doing from here!\nThe RTM website is clean, slick, and easy to use (especially if you make the effort to memorise the keyboard shortcuts), which means there is little friction involved in maintaining your tasks during the day, which of course is vital to making any system work.\nOne of the other sites that I’m logged into all day long is Gmail, and there’s a really good Firefox extension (3.0-compatible) which integrates RTM into Gmail brilliantly – RTM can even automatically create a task when you star a mail.\nWhat else? Did I mention the API, Blackberry support, Offline access (via Google Gears), iGoogle widget, Google Calendar integration, Atom feeds, Twitter integration, Google Maps integration…..? The list goes on – if you can think of a neat feature that you’d like to have in a web app circa 2008, chances are that RTM has it.\nGive it a go, but don’t blame me if you become dependent upon it!”\nFor the record, I have no connections with Remember The Milk other than being a very happy user of their product.

I’m a recovering SQL addict. It’s been four weeks since my last stored procedure.\nOne of my reasons for leaving my cosy permanent job and entering the scary cut-throat world of freelancing was to get a broader exposure to different tools, technologies and methodologies, while remaining with my feet planted firmly in the .NET universe. So, when I got offered a position in a team who were using Subversion, Monorail, Ext.JS, NUnit, Oracle and NHibernate, I jumped at the opportunity.\nOf those technologies, it’s definitely NHibernate which has most dramatically changed my perspective on how enterprise solutions can (and should) be developed. For many years now, I’ve considered deep database (particularly SQL Server) skills to be one of my core proficiencies, and have merrily spent (wasted?) countless man hours writing dreary \u0026ldquo;plumbing\u0026rdquo; code, by the way of CRUD stored procedures and repetitive Data Access Layers in order to persist my CLR entities to the RDBMS.\nWell, no longer, those days are over. I’ve seen the light and embraced the wonders of NHibernate. For those who are unfamiliar with it, NHibernate is an Object-Relational Mapper, and is a port of a Java utility, Hibernate. The premise is beautifully simple – by decorating your objects with attributes or, more neatly, by creating XML mapping files, you define the mappings between your .NET domain objects and their persisted representation on the database. Then NHibernate handles all the grunt work of saving your objects to and from the database.\nDigging deeper, I discovered that NHibernate has been developed in such a way as to make it easy to embrace best practices in database access techniques. Several years ago I read through Fowler’s seminal Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, and wondered how I would ever find time to develop solutions which made use of the cunning O-R behavioural patterns he described – Lazy Load, Unit of Work, Identity Map, Query Object, Repository, etc. I utterly failed to pick up on this paragraph on page 171:\n\u0026ldquo;Remember that you don’t have to build a full-featured database-mapping layer. It’s a complicated beast to build, and there are products available that do this for you.\u0026rdquo;\nProducts such as, yes, NHibernate. Or Wilson ORM, or more recently, the LINQ to SQL offering introduced by Microsoft in the .NET 3.5 Framework.\nI’m glad that I have a solid grounding in SQL, and I still believe that other skills related to RDBMSs are useful in the enterprise (i.e. database design, normalisation and index tuning), but I’m pleased that I can now bring myself to relax, stop worrying, and leave an ORM to take care of generating the repetitive CRUD statements required for persisting my domain objects.\nSo, what have I been doing with all this \u0026ldquo;free time\u0026rdquo; that I now have available to me during a hard day at the code face? Well, I’ve been trying to create systems which are more robust and well-designed by making a concerted effort to embrace Test-Driven Development (for real, this time!)

I read plenty of techie books of course, but also made use of local libraries and devoured plenty of books on other subjects, and even found time for some fiction. I think having a young baby in the house was partially responsible for this achievement – not much else to do of an evening any more!\nSome books were great and will remain on my shelves for years to come. Plenty others were quickly returned to the libraries, or resold on Amazon Marketplace. Either way, I figure that it might be a nice addition to the old blog if I take the time to say a few words about some of them, so let’s start with the book I’ve finished most recently.\nInside Microsoft SQL Server 2005: The Storage Engine by Kalen Delaney is one in a series of four books from MS Press, the other three having subtitles of T-SQL Programming, T-SQL Querying, and Query Tuning and Optimization. I suspect that The Storage Engine is the most deep and esoteric of the four volumes, offering an insight into the architecture and inner workings of SQL Server that isn’t matched even by my old favourite SQL Server 2005 Unleashed.\nBy no stretch of the imagination could this be considered an introduction to SQL Server, and frequently I found myself skipping forward a few pages at a time, reasoning to myself that “there is no reason why I will ever need to know this!” – indeed, plenty of the first half of the book on topics such as architecture, configuration, files, logging, and recovery, would be of more use to DBAs and sysadmins rather than developers such as myself – not that it isn’t nice to have an appreciation of these topics though.\nFrom a developer perspective, it is the second half where this book really springs to life, with three great chapters on Tables, Indexes, and Locking \u0026amp; Concurrency. These are 235 pages of pure gold, offering to the willing reader a really deep understanding of what is really going on under the hood, and how exactly MSSQL goes about implementing your requests. It certainly blew apart some of my incorrect assumptions about internal table structures, and has given me a better understanding of the internal structures of clustered and nonclustered indexes.\nSQL Server is one of the most widely used products in Microsoft’s server range, and in my opinion also one of the most widely abused. Anyone who has worked in this industry for any length of time has inevitably witnessed some awful database designs (no primary keys? no foreign keys? no indexes? every column a varchar(50)? you know the kind of thing!), but we can all learn to improve our database designs, and the level of understanding offered by Kalen’s book should help in the quest for perfection.\nAs long as my career keeps its technical focus, and I’m using SQL Server 2005, then this one is a keeper, and I’ve already ordered Kalen’s other book in the series, Query Tuning and Optimization.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/inside-microsoft-sql-server-2005-the-storage-engine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDuring 2007, I unexpectedly achieved a long-held ambition by increasing the number of books I regularly read (as opposed to merely buying, then leaving them to languish on the bookcase!).

It was a good conference, providing me with some useful and interesting new ideas and food for thought, whilst confirming that our team at Marshalls are generally going about things in “the right way”, which is nice.\nLooking through my notes, the main themes that kept recurring within the different presentations that I attended were:\nAvoid coupling at all costs. Use interfaces, contracts and facades to decouple components. Avoid directly referencing vendor’s class libraries or infrastructure libraries. Appreciate the impact of small decisions which can eventually have a big impact on the overall architecture. Devote more time and consideration to designing interfaces, contracts and public APIs (which are difficulty to change retrospectively), than private implementations which are relatively simple to change. These issues kept coming up again and again – most notably in talks by Kevlin Henney on “The Selfish Object” and Ralf Westphal on “True Component Orientation”, but also to an extent in some of Dave Wheeler’s demonstration of how to use some of the Gang of Four design patterns in .NET. So, it amazed me that a number of my fellow delegates kept raising their hands and asking questions which invariably began “Yeah, but why can’t I just…”, followed by suggestions which effectively seemed to boil down to creating hardcoded, inflexible solutions! To say that this was supposedly a conference of architects, even relatively simple concepts such as Reflection, Polymorphism and Generics seemed to be lost on some people, who apparently would be more comfortable maintaining massive switch statements for the rest of eternity!\nThis is one of the issues I have with the XP rules – I don’t believe that doing the simplest thing that could possibly work is a good idea, at least not when creating public APIs and interfaces. Some forethought is necessary in order to architect loosely coupled solutions that will allow continued flexibility and agility when faced with inevitable change requests. I’m not arguing for the premature development of functionality that may never be required, but interfaces, APIs, inheritance models and database models are a right royal pain to change at a later date and in my experience, upfront design in these areas pays dividends.\nOh, my other issue with the XP rules is the notion of collective code ownership – I’m not precious about my code (honest), but there are inevitably areas of specialism (in terms of technology and business knowledge) in which I seek to focus my energies, and other areas that I don’t care for, or wish to maintain. We can’t all understand everything about every system, and it’s foolish to pretend that this is the case. Allowing or requiring an entire team to be comfortable maintaining the whole codebase is likely to prohibit anybody learning very much about anything, and even with rigorously enforced coding standards and comprehensive unit tests can lead to an unfortunate swiss cheese / patchwork quilt effect. All IMHO, of course.\nMy favourite session of the conference was by Ralf Westphal, who clearly and concisely (his English is better than that of many native speakers!) explained the benefits of using Contract First Development and a microkernel approach to remove component dependencies and development bottlenecks. It’s an approach that I can’t wait to try.\nOne of the other things that pleased me about the conference was the realisation that we at Marshalls are (especially for such a stable, old-economy company), way ahead of the pack in terms of technology – whilst other delegates I spoke with are still using earlier versions of .NET, or even still on VB6 / Win32 API, we continue to make appropriate use of the latest offerings from Redmond.\nA few other observations from my days in London:\nTrying to change from the Circle to Piccadilly lines at King’s Cross at rush hour involves crossing a packed concourse buzzing with hardened commuters that brought to mind that Zurich insurance TV advert which shows futuristic cars on traffic signal-free intersections narrowly avoiding collisions thanks to automated guidance systems! Unlike at MSDN events (where all speakers use vanilla installations of Vista/XP and search Windows Live using IE7), there’s a great variety of hardware and software in popular use now – I witnessed presentations on Dell, Sony Vaio, and MacBook (running both OS X and Vista, through BootCamp), with some highly-configured operating systems, and every presenter used Safari or Firefox – no IE in sight. Didn’t see any Ubuntu, mind. Section 20 of the Architect’s Act 1997 prohibits the use of the “Software Architect” job title. Curiously, “Golf Course Architect” is fine. In all respects, central London is about as far removed from the Isle of Mull (where I was a week previously) as it’s possible to imagine. Increasingly so, it really does come across as a kind of city state, a world city, with a cosmopolitan feeling quite unlike anywhere else in the UK.

I took his advice, bought a copy, and it rapidly became one of the most dog-eared and oft-thumbed computing books I have ever owned. It is comprehensive, deep, broad, well-written and covers everything one might ever wish to know about SQL Server 2000. With its help and guidance I came to love and respect Microsoft’s premier database product, passing the 70-229 exam by a comfortable margin.\nSo, following the release of SQL Server 2005, I was hoping that SAMS would publish a similar tome about that new platform. Once said book was announced, I pre-ordered* a copy, and I’m delighted to report that after many months of patient waiting, the sequel (sorry) landed on my desk last week – and for a computing book, it’s simply awesome.\nMicrosoft SQL Server 2005 Unleashed is even bigger than it’s predecessor. In fact, it’s so large that eight chapters have been left out of the physical book, and are included only in a PDF version supplied on CD-ROM. These aren’t just padding or filler, either – they’re solid chapters on interesting topics as Notification Services, Service Broker, Recovery Planning, and T-SQL Tips n Tricks. Including the bonus chapters, the whole package weighs in at over 2,000 pages – no wonder I had to wait a while for its publication!\nI think you would be hard-pressed to find any other single SQL 2005 book which covers quite so much material to such depth.

Atop the tower are three “thrill rides”, and I foolishly tried all of them whilst Jocelyn videoed proceedings from a safe distance.\nThe Big Shot, at 329m high is the highest ride in the world. This is essentially a big pole with seats around the side that flings you straight up, quickly, and drops you down again. You’ve probably seen these elsewhere, this is much the same except it happens to be on the top of a very tall building and hence offers mighty fine views over the Las Vegas desert.

From inside the building Jocelyn captured the video below – turn up the volume to hear some Aussie tourists laughing at my predicament!\nInsanity, at 274m high is the second highest ride in the world. According to Wikipedia, “it dangles riders over the edge of the tower and then spins in a circular pattern at approximately forty miles per hour”. This was also pretty scary, though the constant circular motion made it less terrifying than the X-Scream (with its stop-start “aha, you thought you were going to continue falling for another 100+ storeys” shenanigans).

This is a qualification that I’ve been working towards on and (more often than not) off for the past four years or so. It’s not really the case that the exams were super-hard, just that it took occasional motivation to get round to taking them!\nSo, was it worth it? Did I learn anything en route? Did the exams boost my employability? Would I be more inclined to employ someone with an MCSD than an applicant without?\nStepping back in time a little, my first real conversation about .Net was in November 2000, at a job interview for a position with ioko{.} (then Infocom), when Matthew{.} asked me something vague along the lines of “what did I understand regarding Microsoft’s .NET initiative?” I honestly can’t remember my answer, but it can’t have utterly sucked as I got the job, and started the following month.\nA year later, December 2001, and I attended the two-day .NET launch at the London Hilton, at which a certain Bill Gates gave a keynote speech explaining why .NET was the future. It was one of the few sessions at that conference which didn’t go over my head – the rest utterly blew my mind, and made me feel extremely ignorant – me with my VB6 and ASP3 skills!\nAnother year passed, and a quiet market meant that I still hadn’t had any opportunity to cut my teeth on any .NET projects. But crucially (and in retrospect foolishly), I also hadn’t put any personal effort into learning these important new technologies. So, on 3rd December 2002, I ordered some self-study books for exams 70-315 and 70-316. Apparently expecting to learn by osmosis, I then popped them on my bookshelf, and headed off to Australia to visit my friends Bruce and Suzanne.\nWhen I got back from Down Under, in January 2003, my job at ioko was not waiting for me. That quiet market wasn’t getting any noisier, a cull had to occur, and, since I didn’t have any proven .Net skills…\nRedundancy wasn’t a pleasant experience, and I wanted to get back into the world of work ASAP (after all, the mortgage wasn’t going to pay itself), so I quickly took up what I always expected to be a stop-gap VB6/ASP job – the pay wasn’t great but it beat daytime TV, spamming the employment agencies and constantly refreshing jobserve.com. It was at this point in time I realised that the only person with the capability to improve my skills and career prospects was myself. For too long I had equated career success to “luck” in being placed on the right projects. Now it was time for me to invest some time and energy learning those all-important .NET skills that I’d been reading about for the past few years.\nFor much of the long hot summer of 2003, I burnt the midnight oil developing a three-tier web application for the investment club of which I was the treasurer at that time. This served a number of purposes: Of course, the website was useful to those who had access to it, but more importantly to me, it provided a way to develop the .NET skills that I saw as being the keys to a better job. Now, the obvious shortcoming of using a personal project as a way to learn a set of technologies is that you’re unlikely to stumble across those enterprise-y features in the Framework that are of particular use in business scenarios. So, I supplemented my late-night hacking sessions (which incidentally resulted in my neighbours complaining about my playing pop music at 2am) with some diligent studying of the 70-306 guide that I’d bought the previous winter. On 14th June 2003, after spending around £80 of my own cash to take the exam, I passed that test, becoming an MCP for the first time.\nWas it worth it? I think so. My efforts meant I got a good grounding in aspects of the technologies that I would not otherwise have stumbled across, and it gave me something concrete and .NET-related to put on my CV (effectively saying “yeah, I know I haven’t worked with these technologies professionally, but that doesn’t mean I don’t understand them”). A few months later, as the market started to gradually pick up again, I got the job I still have – as a .NET developer for Marshalls. I’ve no doubt that the MCP exam helped to at least get my foot in the door.\nI took the remaining four exams at my leisure over the next few years. Whilst studying for the SQL Server (70-229), Web Services and Server Components (70-320) and Requirements and Architectures (70-300) exams, I always found myself learning several things that I hadn’t picked up on the job – in that sense at least, I think undertaking the exams was worthwhile. The final exam I took was the Windows App exam (70-316), and this was a bit of a stroll in all honesty, after the previous four exams and three year’s of .NET experience.\nWould I be more inclined to employ someone with an MCSD than an applicant without? I think the qualification helps greatly in identifying potential candidates, but there are many other factors that make a good developer that aren’t covered in any depth by these exams. Design Patterns and OOP concepts in general were not really tested, even on the 70-300 exam. Knowledge of IIS was not covered on 70-306 – I guess it’s assumed that this is the realm of the Systems Administrator rather than the coder, but in reality (especially in small teams), a good ASP.NET developer needs an intimate understanding of how their web server works and is configured. What about covering topics such as source control, automated builds, and release management? Issues such as unit testing and the benefits of code reviews were mentioned in the 70-300 exam, but there’s a difference between knowing the theory and applying this in practice. An MCSD qualification certainly demonstrates the former, but a few searching questions at interview are still required to prove the latter.\nSo what’s next for me? Upgrading to the “MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer” qualification is the obvious path, and I’ll probably do so in due course, but right now I’d like to like to spend more time getting to grips with SQL Server 2005 by taking the relevant MCTS exam (70-431). If that goes well, then maybe I’ll continue onto the MCITP: DB Dev qualification. We’ll see.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/ian-nelson-mcsd-net/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am now a Microsoft Certified Solution Developer in .NET 1.x technologies.

The mental challenges offered from getting married, changing jobs and moving home have passed, and my free evenings and weekends were becoming prone to bouts of restlessness and sighs of “I’m bored”. This is not a good thing.\nI’ve been toying with the idea of buying a Digital SLR for a while, but the initial outlay for all the required kit would be close to four figures, a sum not easy to come by after the aforementioned marriage and house move. Besides, I’m not sure that taking up a pastime which is essentially outdoor in nature is a good idea as the nights draw in and we enter the almost perpetual darkness of a British winter.\nSo, inspired by WDYTYA and the wife’s purchase of a Martha Stewart genealogy fan chart, I decided that the time was right for me to do one of those “things I’ve always meant to do” and start tracing our family trees.\nLike life insurance, dating, and selling unwanted tat to unsuspecting strangers, genealogy is one of those areas that has been radically transformed by the proliferation of the web. I can’t imagine how much slower it would be to undertake this research just ten or fifteen years ago. Sites like Ancestry, Scotland’s People, and even simple things like online certificate ordering from the GRO have really reduced the time taken to trace lines back, at least over the last couple of centuries. A couple of months ago I knew the names of six of my direct ancestors (i.e. my parents and grandparents). Today I know 66, with more potential lines of research still untapped. My database currently contains 298 individuals, with more to be keyed in later tonight. Virtually all of this has been discovered via an ethernet cable without leaving the comfort of my office.\nBut on some of my lineage I’m now starting to reach the limits of what is possible using the web alone. It turns out that my great-great-grandfather, John Nelson, was born in County Monaghan, Ireland, in the mid-nineteenth century. The Irish government are being somewhat tardy at putting their records online, so if I want to know more I’m going to have to find out in person. Fortunately, we already have plans to visit Dublin later this month, so a visit to the Irish GRO isn’t entirely out of the question.\nI’m still very much a beginner at this game, but here are a few links and tips that I’ve amassed so far:\nDecent genealogy software will make it much easier to keep track of your findings. Amazon have the BBC-branded version of GSP’s Family Tree Maker software for £19.99, which I’ve found to be more than adequate so far. This comes with a free thirty-day subscription to the UK datasets on Ancestry.co.uk. Of course if, like Jocelyn and I, you are interested in relatives from both sides of the pond, you’ll probably end up buying a “World” subscription to Ancestry anyway. If your software offers the ability to give each individual in your database a unique reference number, use it! Half the folk in my tree seem to be called Benjamin, Joseph and William, and it’s all too easy to get them confused! From the earliest stages of your research, keep a note of your sources. This can’t be emphasised enough, as you risk having to repeat your research otherwise. I failed to note my sources initially as I got caught up in the fun of the research, and now I look at some facts in my database and wonder “but how do I know that?”. If, like me, you have Scottish blood, then Scotland’s People is an invaluable trove of information, with digitized BMD records going back to 1855, the Scottish census returns, and searchable parish records to 1513. Don’t jump to conclusions. Just because a search only yields one result doesn’t mean it’s the individual you seek. Datasets can be incomplete, or names can be spelled differently (William, Willm, Wm, Will, Willie; Benjamin, Benjm, Ben, Benny…). I am now the proud owner of a birth certificate for an individual who shares the name and birth year of one of my ancestors, but isn’t him! OneWorldTree and other sites which allow you to link your tree to others can be a great way of sharing research and rapidly discovering entire branches of your family, but take everything with a large pinch of salt! You don’t believe everything you read on the internet, do you? Before convincing yourself that you’ve traced your family all the way back to Adam, get sources for all the pertinent facts. “The Genealogist’s Internet” by Peter Christian is a mine of useful information for those using the net to undertake this kind of research. I’m sure other books will prove useful for the next (offline) stages of my investigation, but I’m still waiting for Amazon to deliver a couple of those.

For obvious reasons, I can’t blog about the trials I was involved with, but it was a fascinating couple of weeks, and it would be a shame not to share some of the experience with you.\nWhenever I mentioned my upcoming service to friends and colleagues, their responses fell into one of two camps: either, “Ugh, I’d hate that! I’d really dread doing jury service!” or, “You lucky sod, I’d love to do that, but I’ve never been asked!” The thought of serving on a jury clearly polarises people, and I must confess, I felt a certain dread when I first received my summons.\nMy duty was a long time coming. I was originally summoned in early 2005 to attend in April of that year, but as that coincided with my wedding, I deferred until the autumn. When that time approached, I received a phone call informing me that they had too many potential jurors for the week in question, and I was given the option of deferring until a fortnight of my choice in 2006. It was quite an odd question to be asked out of the blue. “Just pick a week!” the moody woman on the phone instructed me, seemingly oblivious to the fact that I might need more than a moment’s consideration. It would have been easier if they hadn’t given me a choice! Eventually, I decided I’d rather take the short stroll to court during the summer months but not when Jocelyn was on summer vacation from her teaching job. And so it was that I found myself pitching up at York Crown Court one Monday morning a few weeks ago.\nIt would be remiss of me not to mention the architecture. The court building at York is gorgeous, steeped in history, and sits near Clifford’s Tower and the Castle Museum. It must be a lovely place to work, especially in the summer months.\nI was pleasantly surprised by how friendly and down-to-earth all the staff were. From the security guards who checked my bags each morning to the ushers and the guy responsible for the jurors, everyone was pleasant and approachable, in stark contrast to the perceived serious and sombre nature of the surroundings. They did everything they could to put us at ease, and it was telling that, while many people turned up in shirt and tie on the first day, the standard of dress noticeably declined in the following days. There’s little pretence required in the role of juror—you’re there to represent the average person on the street, and if that means wearing jeans and a T-shirt, so be it.\nIf you find yourself summoned for jury service, my number one piece of advice is this: take something to read. There is a lot of sitting around, and no guarantee you will even see a trial during your service. Some redundancy is necessary in case a juror’s suitability is challenged (e.g., if they know the defendant or a key witness), and a surprisingly large number of trials do not proceed due to guilty pleas being entered at the last minute. It can be boring for those of you waiting in the jury room, so a newspaper or a good book is highly recommended.\nOn my first day, I was sent home at about 1:00 pm.\nOn my second day, I was sent home at about 12:30 pm.\nOn my third day, I was sent home at lunchtime and told that, due to a lack of cases, there was no need for me to return until the following week.\nAt this point, I felt a bit cheated. Here I was, diligently offering my time to faithfully try a peer, and my services weren’t required. I sulked back to the office for two days, grumbling about the court service in general.\nThe following Monday, I returned to court and met a new group of jurors just starting their stint. They were easily distinguishable by their shirts, ties, and slightly nervous expressions. Had I looked like that just seven days earlier? I scoffed inwardly and reassured them that, if my experience was anything to go by, they wouldn’t see the inside of a courtroom. How wrong I was…\nIn my second week, I served on two cases. The first was a relatively minor burglary, and the second involved a much more serious set of charges. The atmosphere in the courtroom for both cases was formal and precise, but at no point did I feel nervous or intimidated. In fact, it felt quite proper and natural to be sitting on the jury benches, carefully listening to the cases made by both the prosecution and the defence.\nThere was a lot to absorb. Before my experience, I thought a day running from 10:30 am to 4:30 pm, with a 75-minute lunch break, sounded like a doddle. But try listening to two and a half hours of continuous evidence from a witness—observing their expressions, mannerisms, and gestures, considering how this squares with other evidence heard earlier or several days ago, and keeping track of the arguments and lines of questioning. It’s surprisingly gruelling, especially if your daily work involves dealing more with computers than people! By 4:30 pm, I was always ready to head home, and it never felt like I’d done only half a day’s work.\nEach day, the judge advised us to “switch off,” relax at home, and avoid thinking about the case overnight. Easier said than done. It’s not like watching a TV drama—this is real life, with real defendants facing prison, real victims, and real consequences. You have to take it seriously, and I’m pleased to say that everyone on the two juries I sat on did so.\nAs I mentioned earlier, it would be unlawful and improper for me to comment on the cases themselves, but I can say that, in both trials, we found the defendants guilty on one or more counts. Neither decision was easy or straightforward, and both were preceded by many hours of engaging and measured debate that restored my faith in my fellow humans (no, really).\nAfterwards, I learned details about the defendants—such as their prior records—that would have made the decisions much easier had we known them beforehand. But rightly, this information is withheld; you have to base your judgement solely on the facts of the case, which often don’t tell the whole story.\nAt the end of my jury service, I returned to the office with renewed confidence in the British judicial system. Does that sound corny? It isn’t meant to. Seeing justice being administered firsthand and having a say in the outcome is an incredibly empowering experience. Would I want to do it every day? Absolutely not. Trying one’s peers is definitely a duty best carried out infrequently, ensuring randomness and a balance that delivers accurate verdicts more often (a bit like choosing which Big Brother housemate to evict?!). But yes, I enjoyed my jury service. And if another envelope with bold pink lettering drops through my letterbox, I’ll look forward to the break from my usual routine.\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/jury-service/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’ve recently completed a stint of jury service, which lasted a little over two weeks at York Crown Court.

of Breakfast Prep’, courtesy of Jocelyn. It had been a couple of years since I’d last had Breakfast In America, and I’d forgotten how to respond to the awesome number of choices and options that would be flung in my direction by the waitperson.\nHere’s how you order breakfast in Britain:\n\u0026lt;td\u0026gt; \u0026amp;#8220;\u0026lt;a

due course, the standard, empire-forging breakfast is served, and is consumed heartily, perhaps after a little trading with your breakfasting companions (“I’ll swap you my tomatoes for a rasher of your bacon?”). Everybody knows what is expected, nobody has tricky decisions to make, there are no surprises, and everyone enjoys what they get – and if they don’t enjoy it, well, they don’t mention it, because complaining about such things just wouldn’t be British, damn it.\nNow, compare that if you will to the American breakfasting experience. The sheer size of the American breakfast menu is symptomatic of the culture of Choice that seems to pervade all aspects of the consumer experience here (especially in California), and it really can take some time to pick an option. But making your selection is only the beginning. Here’s how a sample breakfast order conversation with an unexpecting Brit (i.e. me, two years ago), might go:\n\u0026lt;td\u0026gt; \u0026amp;#8220;Are you ready to

started to dab at my heavily perspiring brow. Who ever knew that ordering breakfast could be such a complicated experience? The food is invariably delicious and the portions are big enough to feed a family of four for a week – after a decent US-style breakfast I rarely feel the need for a big lunch or dinner. I can see how these levels of choice might be appealing if you’ve grown up with them and come to expect such options, but for the uninitiated it’s just baffling, confusing, and seems unnecessary. Which is why, two years later, I won’t venture into a breakfast restaurant until I’ve done a

first transatlantic driving experience to come during rush hour at the end of a long day’s travelling – and I gazed out of the window, musing again at the open, opportune feeling of the region, despite its large population. There are new buildings springing up, visible signs of affluence, and it all combines to create the feeling (illusion?) that anything is possible, there’s no history to hold back your dreams. And of course, as a professional software developer, I was very aware of the kind of businesses to be found in cities such as Mountain View, Sunnyvale, and Palo Alto, that we sped through.\nBack home, there’s something about York – the wealth of history, the cramped streets maybe – that convinces me that it’s nigh-on impossible to get noticed or make an impact in such a city. How can you make your mark in a city with so many Roman remains on every street corner? There’s always a nagging feeling that someone got there first, that it’s all been done before. Name some famous people who’ve made an impact in York? Ivar the Boneless? John Sentamu? Dame Judi Dench? Rick Witter…? I hypothesised that this might partly explain the large number of Guilds, Companies, Lodges, Fraternities and Clubs in the city – people band together in an effort to attain power and influence. Is there a Company of Merchant Adventurers in North California? I suspect not.\nI shared my musings with Jocelyn. She said \u0026ldquo;Well… what sort of an impact would you like to make?\u0026quot; I confessed that I didn’t have the foggiest idea. She rightly suggested that maybe it

entitled Freakonomics – A Rogue Economist Explores The Hidden Side Of Eveything, and now I finally had time to read through it. I surprised myself by finishing it by the time we reached Chicago – this may be a chunky hardback book on economics, but it’s also really interesting and easy-going.\nThe book answers a mixed bag of questions – Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? – by using standard economic tools. The results are fascinating – go check out some chapter excerpts on the website if you don’t believe me.\nAnyway, that book, combined with Barney, my trusty iPod made the flights, well, fly by. It was the first time I’ve travelled whilst carrying almost my entire music collection in my pocket, and having that level of choice really pleased me. Previously, no matter how many tapes or CDs I carried, there would always be something left at home that I had a desperate urge to listen to, and I never seemed to have the music to match my mood – which is essential for an INTP.\nAt O’Hare airport, we discovered a small advantage of our transatlantic marriage – we can choose to go through passport control together through either the \u0026ldquo;citizens\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;foreigners\u0026rdquo; queue (natually, we picked the shorter one), in order to provide a complete picture to the immigration officer. The time savings we gained here were, however, subsequently lost when we inadvertantly picked up the wrong suitcase at baggage reclaim – I ask you, what are the chances of somebody else having the exact same model of case, and tying a blue ribbon around the handle to make it more easily identifiable? Less minimal than we expected, evidently…\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/usa-trip-2006-journey/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e_Monday 10th April 2006\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003eTravelling West during the daytime is a blast, especially on a sunny day.  Time it right and you can experience daylight for 24 hours, which afforded me time to catch up on some reading.  For Christmas Joce had given a book entitled \u003ca href=\"http://www.freakonomics.com/\"\u003eFreakonomics – A Rogue Economist Explores The Hidden Side Of Eveything\u003c/a\u003e, and now I finally had time to read through it.  I surprised myself by finishing it by the time we reached Chicago – this may be a chunky hardback book on economics, but it’s also \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e interesting and easy-going.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"USA Trip 2006: Journey"},{"content":"Last month Jocelyn and I took a trip to the States to visit friends and family, attend Teri \u0026amp; Jimmy’s wedding, and take a vacation to Nevada and Arizona.\nSo, there we were, sitting at the departure gate at Manchester Airport on a bright Monday morning, having awoken at 0430 to make our way across the Pennines. A few seats away were a group of teenagers. They were from Michigan, and they were annoyingly noisy. Thus began our American adventure.\nJoce was the first to show irritation at her countrymen – \u0026ldquo;God, why is it that only the fat obnoxious noisy American choose to travel abroad?\u0026rdquo;. In retrospect, I’m not sure that’s true – it’s just that, by their nature, you’re more likely to notice obnoxious noisy people, of any nationality, and the non-native accents just make them stand out even more. As it happened, there were some British teens mixed into the group – some kind of exchange trip between West Yorkshire and Michigan, no doubt providing some well-earned relief for the parents.\nIgnoring this noise, we focused our attentions instead on the cute little lass (circa 2 or 3 years?) wandering round with wide eyes, and playing with her dad. \u0026ldquo;We’ll have kids like that,\u0026rdquo; Joce told me. Yikes!\n","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/usa-trip-2006-departure/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast month Jocelyn and I took a trip to the States to visit friends and family, attend Teri \u0026amp; Jimmy’s wedding, and take a vacation to Nevada and Arizona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, there we were, sitting at the departure gate at Manchester Airport on a bright Monday morning, having awoken at 0430 to make our way across the Pennines.  A few seats away were a group of teenagers.  They were from Michigan, and they were annoyingly noisy.  Thus began our American adventure.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"USA Trip 2006: Departure"},{"content":"Back in November 2004, I had the idea of making a \u0026ldquo;Generic Sorter for Strongly-Typed Collections\u0026rdquo;, by harnessing the mighty power of reflection.

I used to spend my summer holidays at the sea-side, playing in arcades and seeking the perfect milkshake (lime); more recently I’ve been spending them in the highlands, playing on the hills and seeking the perfect dram (lagavulin). Hmmm…\nI think I may have mentioned that the wife is away in the States for a while. At the start of this period of solitude, I panicked, wondering whatever I could do with myself, and came to the conclusion that it would be a good idea to buy a computer game to while away the hours. After all, I spent much of my formative years killing time on a variety of computer and console games, so why not rekindle that prior love affair? So it was that I bought The Sims 2, a truly excellent game, and had an enjoyable evening trying to motivate my wee Sims to improve their skills, better themselves, and generally enjoy life. All good harmless fun.\nThe following evening, though, I came to resume my game, and… I just couldn’t be bothered. The whole concept seemed utterly pointless, a real waste of time. Why squander an evening encouraging AI sims to develop their skills and improve their house when, here in the real life, I had bookcases to build, books to read, music to enjoy, new DVDs to watch, a fantastic city to go out and enjoy, and skills to learn for my own career? It struck me that many of the finely-honed computer game skills I had developed over the past thirtyish years were of absolutely no use outside the parameters of those particular games.\nSince then, The Sims has sat on a shelf, and I’ve achieved loads over the past few weeks – Jocelyn is soon returning to find the house at the tidiest it’s been in years. I told my mum all this (as you do). She said I’m growing up. About bloody time.\nBut still, those earlier computer games did play a big part during the first three decades of my life, so, in way of tribute, here’s a quick rundown of the dozen games responsible for my most wasted hours:\nGrandstand Adman 2000 The first “console” I ever owned, this featured four (four!) different games – football, squash, tennis and practice. Not only that, but it boasted configurable options for speed, angle, and bat-size! You simply cannot appreciate how many hours I frittered away bouncing that square block against a wall until I encountered 15 “faults” – at which point I would press the reset button and repeat the process. If I’m being charitable to my younger self, then I could suggest that this game at least helped me develop hand-eye coordination, and stopped me mithering my parents for a while.\n“Real Sports Action”, says the box. Well, only if football ever consisted of four vertical bars deflecting a square ball moving with constant speed. Also – “Realistic Sound Effects”. It beeped! That was it! But, y’know, it was all we had, so…\nPhoto by Erik Klooster\nGrandstand BMX Flyer Oh, now this handheld LCD console was (is?) a most favourite game of mine. I can still hum the tune, and I still know that my highest-ever score was 14,070. Brilliant fun – highly addictive and an appealing concept for a seven year-old lad (“avoid the crows!” “jump for the girl in the balloon!” “kick dirt in the baddy’s face!”).\nPhoto by Handheld Museum\nStarter Chess (Commodore 16) I was always a Commodore kid. Speccies and Amstrads, though much more popular with the gamers at school, just didn’t appeal to me. I mean, seriously, how could you write computer programs for hours on end using a rubber keyboard?! Oh, sure, they were much better for games, if you liked that kind of thing. But the C16 came with games too, like.. Starter Chess!\nOK, who am I kidding? Starter Chess was, in all respects, an exercise in patience and sitting around watching a pitifully underpowered computer fail to do very much for what seemed like an interminably long time. First you had to get the game to load, from cassette tape, which always took the best part of twenty minutes. Then, after every chess move played by oneself, the Commodore spent a good five minutes plotting its next move (which it announced with a loud beep). Not very exciting. On the plus side, the computer player wasn’t particularly strong, so it was actually quite conceivable to win, even as a youngster.\nFruit Machine Simulator (Commodore 16) I’m beginning to think I must’ve been a bit of a masochist as a child, because I absolutely loved this single-screen game which attempted to “simulate” a pretty simplistic fruit machine. Press a key to enter some coins. Press another key to pull the lever. Maybe, just maybe, you then have the possibility of pressing further keys to “hold” or “nudge” – oh, the excitement was palpable. It sounds really dull now, but I loved it at the time. I remember trying to figure out the probability with which the various game events occurred – were they truly random, or were they influenced by the user’s actions? What was the average length of a game, before you either went bust or accumulated the target winnings? A future university career in mathematics was already evident..\nKickstart (Commodore 16) Of all the games I had for the C16, Kickstart was the only one that I remember as being truly playable, and remotely “fast”. I was impressed at the time that such a game could run on a machine with such little RAM. This was a motorbike game (as in the old TV show, Kickstart, which I also loved), and, like BMX Flyer years early, basically involved making the bike jump at the appropriate time – balloons were involved again too, and there was an irritating-to-adults soundtrack. Quality.\nLemmings (Amiga) The Christmas that brought me an Amiga 500 played a big part in sealing my future career direction. For the first time, I was able to tinker with a real operating system (with GUI), more powerful programming languages, hard disks, multitasking applications, etc. But that Christmas day itself was mostly spent playing Lemmings, which should need no introduction as it’s one of the most popular games of its time, and has been ported across to many platforms, including DHTML!\nStunt Car Racer (Amiga) Stunt Car Racer was initially a very hard game. But, persevere and you would discover the “knack” to each of the eight challenging courses. So, persevere I did, and eventually reached the top of division one! It seemed like such an achievement at the time, but it’s not exactly something I can put on my CV in 2005, is it?\nGods (Amiga) Gods was a platform game by the Bitmap Brothers, with a kicking introductory theme tune, and the game was pretty cool too. Lots of different weapons, puzzles, and backgrounds ensured a game which remained enjoyable as you progressed through the levels. Also a good variety of monsters, who boasted a much-hyped AI, in stark contrast to the usual sprites of the day who tended to attack by following predictable (circular) routes. Brilliant.\nCivilization series (Amiga / PC) Of all the games mentioned, I have spent the most time playing the various incarnations of Civilization on the Amiga and latterly on the PC. Indeed, Civ 3 with the Play The World expansion gets my vote for greatest computer game of all time. It’s such a brilliant concept – start with a few stone-age settlers in 4000BC and nurture them through 6000 years of growth, discovery, technological development, war and peace until they either achieve world domination or make the leap to Alpha Centauri (OK, I hear there are some other victory conditions, but these are the only two I’ve ever really found interesting). The level of attachment you can feel to your civilization after playing this game for an entire weekend is really quite disturbing. Addictive to the extreme, and often responsible for my eyes feeling very sore indeed…\nWorms (PC) If it wasn’t for Worms, I suspect myself and some of the other Grovey Roaders would have achieved 2:1 degrees instead of the 2:2s we all took from Nottingham uni. But, alas, Worms was just such good fun, and so sociable… what better way to spend evenings in our final year than commanding crack squads of four worms each to kick each other’s butts to entertaining effect? Well, except for going to The Irish, of course.\nQuake (PC) I missed the whole Doom thing as I didn’t get a PC until leaving uni in 1997. Quake was therefore the first FPS I ever played, and thus swiftly passed another summer of my youth.\nGran Turismo 2 (Playstation) GT2 was the reason I bought a Playstation, and it was the only PSX game I played for any length of time. At the time I had a Ford Puma, so within the game I made a point of buying the exact same model in the same colour. How sad is that? As with my recent Sims 2 epiphany, I was eventually struck by the thought “why am I doing this within the virtual confines of a computer game when I could be doing it out in the real world?”. I didn’t explain this line of reasoning to the magistrate though, and the six points should come off my driving licence in a few year’s time… 😉\nThere you have it, the dirty dozen responsible for wasting much of the best years of my life. Who knows, without those distractions, maybe by now I would otherwise be a Nobel laureate, or rich and famous… or maybe I would have no hand-eye coordination, be unable to use a mouse, and not have the programming talents that now put food on our table.

Three stops down to Oxford Circus seemed to last as long as the entire preceeding train journey. How people do this every single day I do not know..\nAnyway, I digress. The tech briefing was excellent, a full day’s set of presentations on eXtreme development practices by the very erudite and engaging Dr Neil Roodyn, with additional demos by some of the MSDN UK guys. During questioning, nobody in the audience was arguing against using the XP practices espoused, in fact most questioners simply wanted to know how to get project managers and business leaders bought in to the ideas. The general consensus was that suits and customers don’t want to hear about pair programming and TDD, they want to see devs working on coding new functionality, which is obviously frustrating for those of us cutting the code. Hopefully sessions like the one on Friday will help to inspire a groundswell of enthusiasm for agile practices amongst developers and team leads which the business leaders will eventually be unable to ignore. Dr Neil suggested that we don’t try to immediately enforce all 12 XP principles in our workplaces, but start using those which work for us, basically those which we can sneak in under the managements noses! Nobody can stop you from writing unit tests and adopting a TDD approach to your coding, and may only start asking questions when they see how much more productive you’re becoming, and how fewer bugs are found in your code. After all, producing quality code is your job, and nobody will stop you from doing your job well.\nWhile I remember, some of the books mentioned by Neil were:\n\u0026ldquo;Software For Your Head\u0026rdquo; by Jim McCarthy \u0026ldquo;The Tipping Point\u0026rdquo; by Malcolm Gladwell \u0026ldquo;Fooled By Randomness\u0026rdquo; by Nassim Nicholas Taleb and I have noted down that I should find the time to visit:\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/uk/msdn/postevents – for a copy of the slides http://agilealliance.com http://www.xpertise.co.uk ","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/extreme-net/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUp at 0500 yesterday and onto the early GNER Mallard down to that London town for the MSDN briefing on eXtreme programming with .NET.

Having determined that I could hand over my Barclaycard whilst flashing my wedding ring, I brought my current reading list up to three:\nDeveloper to Designer: GUI Design for the Busy Developer – this was a wedding present from my mother-in-law and is proving to be an interesting, easy-going read so far. My competencies lie in the middle tier and database, and although I’m technically capable of making GUIs, I prefer to leave the design up to others. It’s inevitable though that most coders end up doing some design, and this book is, er, designed (sorry) to help with that process. The early section of the book concentrates on each UI element in turn, whilst the later part of the book looks at putting it all together, and has particular focus on the web – layout design patterns and interaction patterns. It’s a good read, making a nice contrast from the heavier books, and I’m pleased to learn that I’m not alone in hating Outlook’s labyrinthine Tools-\u0026gt;Options dialog!\nEffective C#: 50 Specific Ways to Improve Your C# – another good read that isn’t too heavy, this is a good book of short hints and tips to dip into when waiting for the latest CTPs of VS and SQL Server to install (well, at least that’s when I’ve found myself reading it). Depending on your level of experience with C#, you may find some of these suggestions are teaching you to suck eggs, but they all come with detailed justifications that provide useful insights into .NET internals, and out of fifty points you’re bound to find something that you didn’t previously know. If you’re new to C#, get this book now and put it’s suggestions into practice from the start. If you think you’re an expert, borrow a copy and use it as a checklist of your knowledge.\nHead First Design Patterns – this is the book I picked up yesterday (yes, partly because of the cute blonde on the cover), but it was the outstanding content that stopped me putting it down again. This doesn’t feel like a normal O’Reilly book, and it feels very far removed from the original Gang of Four’s Design Patterns book – yet it covers the same material. This is a patterns book that won’t send you to sleep, that will make you laugh, that will make those tricky concepts sink in and your misconceptions float away. It’s cool, clever, succinct and quite unlike any other tech book I’ve read. The only slight downer is that all the examples are in Java, but this really shouldn’t be an issue for any half-competent C# developer.

It’s inevitable though that most coders end up doing some design, and this book is, er, designed (sorry) to help with that process. The early section of the book concentrates on each UI element in turn, whilst the later part of the book looks at putting it all together, and has particular focus on the web – layout design patterns and interaction patterns.

End users shouldn’t have to concern themselves with the concept of Session expiry, and it’s unacceptable for them to return to their PC after nipping off for a coffee to be confronted with the dreaded \u0026ldquo;Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u0026rdquo; when they try to continue editing their basket / sales order / timesheet / whatever.\nOne pattern to solve this, detailed by Martin Fowler in Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, is the Serialized LOB (Large Object), which works by serializing the object in question into binary or text which is then stored in a single database field.\nAn excellent example of how to achieve this using SQL Server and .NET is given by Peter A Bromberg in this Egghead Cafe article.\nBuilding on this example, I’ve put together a generic assembly for persisting and retrieving serializable classes into SQL Server, referenced by a combination of two strings (a username and a key). It is essentially an alternative to storing objects in Session or ViewState. As an additional benefit, it allows you to \u0026ldquo;lock\u0026rdquo; objects based on the key, so that only one user can store the same object at a given point in time.\nThe zip file below includes the source and a SQL script for setting up the required database table and four stored procedures, as well as some unit tests (yes, I am sticking to my New Year’s Resolution!).\nThe DataStore class contains the various static methods necessary to add, retrieve and delete objects from the store. For example, to save an object you can simply make a call along the lines of:\nDataStore.Add(\u0026quot;joebloggs\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;order1234\u0026quot;,objOrder); Note that if an object already exists in the store for a given user/key combination, it will be overwritten.\nIf you additionally want to ensure that no other users have also stored an object with the same name into the store, pass true into the optional fourth parameter:\nDataStore.Add(\u0026quot;joebloggs\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;order1234\u0026quot;,objOrder,true); this would throw an ObjectLockedException if any user other than “joebloggs” had previously locked an object called “order1234”.\nTo retrieve an object, use the Get method. If the object is not found, this will return null. Otherwise, an instance of PersistedObject will be returned – this details information such the datetime at which the object was originally stored and last stored, as well as whether it is locked. The actual object itself is accessible through a \u0026ldquo;StoredObject\u0026rdquo; property.\nSo, to retrieve the sales order object above from the store, a call would be like this:\nSalesOrder objOrder = DataStore.Get(\u0026quot;joebloggs\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;order1234\u0026quot;).StoredObject as SalesOrder; That’s pretty much it. There are also methods to retrieve a collection of objects from the store (GetByUser, GetByKey), as well as methods to remove objects from the store (Remove, RemoveByKey, RemoveByUser, Clear).\nFeel free to use and cannibalize this code as you see fit. Let me know if you find it useful or interesting, and of course if you have any suggestions for improvements. Oh, and of course it should go without saying that I make no guarantee as to the suitability of this code for any purpose and accept no responsibility for any loss of data etcetera!\nUpdated 30 October 2005:\nI’ve reworked this code for .NET 2.0, and removed the dependency on the Microsoft Data Access Application Block.

After passing the tour party, and politely greeting the contractors working on the footpath as I passed them, I found myself pretty much alone on this cute conical hill, spiralling up higher until the path whittled away to nothing and I came to the conclusion that a bit of scrambling was the order of the day. Soon afterwards, I’d made myself onto the rugged summit. The sun was shining, I could see for miles, I was alone and free and happy – king of the castle, for a short while at least.\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2013_03_04_22_25_56.jpg\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;1197\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;2114\u0026quot; loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; alt srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_2013_03_04_22_25_56.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_2013_03_04_22_25_56.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2013_03_04_22_25_56.jpg 1197w\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2013_03_04_22_25_59.jpg\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;1193\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;3026\u0026quot; loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; alt srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_2013_03_04_22_25_59.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_2013_03_04_22_25_59.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2013_03_04_22_25_59.jpg 1193w\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2013_03_04_22_26_03.jpg\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;1198\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;2126\u0026quot; loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; alt srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_2013_03_04_22_26_03.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_2013_03_04_22_26_03.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2013_03_04_22_26_03.jpg 1198w\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/1999/04/2013_03_04_22_26_04-1.jpg\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;1195\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;2120\u0026quot; loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; alt srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2013_03_04_22_26_04-1.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_2013_03_04_22_26_04-1.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/1999/04/2013_03_04_22_26_04-1.jpg 1195w\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2013_03_04_22_26_08.jpg\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;1197\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;2112\u0026quot; loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; alt srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_2013_03_04_22_26_08.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_2013_03_04_22_26_08.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2013_03_04_22_26_08.jpg 1197w\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; That evening, after celebrating the end of a great holiday by dining at a superb seafood restaurant, we found ourselves in a sparsely-populated bar which was holding a karaoke night. After a bit of Dutch courage, we found ourselves in our element once more, as we took to the “stage” and began mauling some of our favourite tunes. We did California Dreamin’, Hey Jude, Tequila, Angels, Daydream Believer, Chocolate Salty Balls, and others too painful to remember. We were on fine form, and had a good laugh with the incredibly hospitable locals. The SNP may keep harping on about “Scotland’s Oil,” but in my opinion the nation’s greatest asset is the people of Scotland, especially in places like Ullapool. One day, when I’m tired of the rat race, motorways and shopping malls, when Yorkshire has descended into urban squalor, perpetual car crime and vandalism, I’ll consider retiring to the Highlands.

One of his female housemates once commented that “he really looks after us in the flat, he’s like the Dad of the house!” and I can now sort of imagine how this is true. I get the feeling people are likely to misrepresent him as being some kind of mad Scottish loony, especially when up on the munros, risking his life for the sake of a quick bag or a bit of a laugh, but I’m beginning to think that under the “ker-azy” exterior, he’s alarmingly sensible. Posit: we’re at the bottom of a gorgeous snow-covered gully on Buachaille Etive Mor, and I’m gagging to don some crampons (lent to me by the man himself), and get going. But Brucey has other ideas:\n“Look, you’re not f*cking going up there until you practice some ice-axe brakes!”\nIn retrospect, this made good sense, but at the time I could have died of embarrasment. I was going to be forced to do something I was crap at, in a situation I was uncomfortable in – and to make matters worse, some strangers were just about to wander past. I remembered why I never learned to swim.\n“Just sit down, lift your feet up, slide down for a few metres, then turn round and dig your axe in. You’re not going up there until you’ve proved you can do it!”\nThis wasn’t the loony I’d come to know and love, who’d been thrown out of a club for trying to serve himself a pint of wine, who’d antagonised drunken youths outside the Ceilidh in Fort William, who’d fought with me two years previous over the matter of a now-hingeless kitchen door (and indeed, with the same kitchen door!)\n“But I’ll get me arse wet!,” I pleaded. It didn’t cut ice. Only the ice-axe would do that. Five attempts and a severely soggy bum later, Bruce conceded that I’d “got the general idea.” In retrospect, I was thankful. As with previous occasions in my life, it’s always been my friends who’ve given me the advice I didn’t want, but needed to hear, or forced me to do the things I didn’t want to, but needed to do.\nMy arse dried mercifully quickly, and the walk continued in superb fashion. The weather held out, the skies were clear, and we could see for miles – brilliant views of Schiehallion, Ben Nevis, and out to Ben More.

It should have been an easy wander down, but, well, to cut a long story short and skip the embarrassing details, I kind of stumbled a bit and went for a roll. I eventually stopped rolling, stood up, fell over again, and continued rolling. Dizzy was not the word for it! Bruised my back quite painfully too (sympathy, please!).

This time I was almost glad to see the signal lights on my mobile phone quietly extinguish. The journey was pretty good – we hadn’t seen Bruce for about a year, as he’d been off seeing the world for the past nine months. This gave us the opportunity to fill him in on nine months of pop culture, which seemed to boil down to:\nCatatonia’s International Velvet Robbie Williams’ Life Thru A Lens South Park Half the World Cup We concluded that maybe he hadn’t missed too much.\nIf there’s a foodstuff that is more likely to induce an instant coronary arrest than battered pizza, I’d love to hear about it. Only the Scots could devise something so potentially lethal. I ordered a half, which was caked in salt and oozing fat. Before I tentatively bit into it, I asked my friends what it tasted like. “Cholesterol,” was their honest reply.\nBruce and Rich, about to bag Schiehallion\nWe reached the base of Schiehallion by around 4:30pm. Although 1,084 metres (3,554 feet) high, it is one of the easiest Munro’s to climb, with a path resembling a huge scar running down the north-eastern side.\n“A whaleback ridge when viewed from the east, Schiehallion (in translation the fairy hill of the Caledonians), appears from the west as a shapely cone. Either way, it dominates views because of its isolated position in the centre of the Highlands. In 1777, the Astronomer Royal conducted experiments on this peak to determine the weight of the Earth.”\n—- Doug Corrance – “Still Moving”\nThe weather held fine, and the walk was incredibly enjoyable – we met many people passing in the opposite direction, including young children, teenagers, and tourists from Vermont and Philadelphia. It was only when we reached the summit that the wind began to batter us, so we took a few obligatory snaps, and headed back down, as the skies were threatening to open.\nOn the way down, I was surprised to discover the grave of one Alexander Fraser, who’d died in 1984. But in retrospect, I can’t think of many better final resting places than Schiehallion.\n\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2013_03_04_22_19_26-1.jpg\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;2000\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;1131\u0026quot; loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; alt srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_2013_03_04_22_19_26-1.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_2013_03_04_22_19_26-1.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/3_2013_03_04_22_19_26-1.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2013_03_04_22_19_26-1.jpg 2111w\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;kg-gallery-image\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img decoding=\u0026quot;async\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2013_03_04_22_19_22-1.jpg\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;1803\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;1195\u0026quot; loading=\u0026quot;lazy\u0026quot; alt srcset=\u0026quot;https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/1_2013_03_04_22_19_22-1.jpg 600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2_2013_03_04_22_19_22-1.jpg 1000w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/3_2013_03_04_22_19_22-1.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.iannelson.uk/uploads/2023/08/2013_03_04_22_19_22-1.jpg 1803w\u0026quot; sizes=\u0026quot;auto, (min-width: 720px) 720px\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ","permalink":"https://bloghugo.iannelson.uk/schiehallion/","summary":"\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravelling Northwards on a weekday when others are working is a wonderfully liberating feeling, especially when you’re heading for Scotland.  This time I was almost glad to see the signal lights on my mobile phone quietly extinguish.  The journey was pretty good – we hadn’t seen Bruce for about a year, as he’d been off seeing the world for the past nine months.  This gave us the opportunity to fill him in on nine months of pop culture, which seemed to boil down to:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Schiehallion"},{"content":"My second Munro.
