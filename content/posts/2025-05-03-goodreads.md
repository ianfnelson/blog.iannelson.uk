Since 2018 I've been reading far more than I used to. Partly that's because my kids have grown older and don't need quite as much of my time (though they still seem to need quite a lot of money). But it's also thanks to Audible. I've been listening to audiobooks while I walk the dog, potter about the house, and commute — effectively turning previously "wasted" time into surprisingly rich reading hours.

Each year, I write a blog post rounding up my favourite reads — [you can find that series here](https://blog.iannelson.uk/series/books-of-the-year/). These have become some of my most popular posts, suggesting that quite a few of you are also on the hunt for good books — or at least enjoy mildly judgmental end-of-year lists.

This year, I’ve started using [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) to track what I’m reading (or listening to) throughout the year. If you’ve enjoyed my annual roundups, you might like to follow me there. I’m not one for long reviews, but I do keep it updated, and you can see what I’m currently enjoying, abandoning, or pretending to have finished.

Yes, Goodreads is owned by Amazon, which I know some people aren’t wild about. Fair enough. It’s not perfect, but it’s a decent tool for keeping track of books, and I’m finding it quite useful so far.

Books I've enjoyed so far in 2025 include:

- _Source Code_ by Bill Gates
- _The Anxious Generation_ by Jonathan Haidt
- _Money_ by David McWilliams
- _How Big Things Get Done_ by Bent Flyvbjerg
- _The Staff Engineer’s Path_ by Tanya Reilly
- _Lessons_ by Ian McEwan
- _The Secret History_ by Donna Tartt
- _Mania_ by Lionel Shriver
- _On Leadership_ by Tony Blair

If any of those appeal — or if you’re simply curious about what I’m reading when I’m not wrangling distributed systems or Lego bricks — you can follow me here: <https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/119445213-ian-nelson>
