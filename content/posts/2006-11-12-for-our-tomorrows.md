On this Remembrance Sunday, permit me to share with you a photo that my cousin Helen took this week of our Granduncle&#8217;s grave in France.

Private William Henry Worfolk (1896 &#8211; 1916) of the York and Lancaster Regiment was my Grandfather&#8217;s elder brother (by four years), and was only just old enough to fight (and die) in the First World War.  A couple of years later and it could just as easily have been my grandfather, and then I wouldn&#8217;t be here to tell you this tale.  Ninety years on from that most bloody of wars, we still have much to be thankful for.<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
