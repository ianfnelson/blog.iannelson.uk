Smuggler&#8217;s Ale is another bottled beer which found its way into my calendar via an [Asda beer competition][1].  It&#8217;s 5% ABV, with hints of treacle, and is really rather enjoyable.

And to paraphrase Forrest Gump, that&#8217;s all I have to say about that.  Back to my beer and a DVD of [Family Guy][2].
