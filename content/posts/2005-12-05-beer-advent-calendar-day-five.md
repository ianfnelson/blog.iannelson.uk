Today&#8217;s festive ale is the Teignworthy Christmas Cracker, a strong (6% ABV) dark and warming malty bottle conditioned ale from deepest Devon.

Um, it&#8217;s OK, certainly tastes weighty and, well, worthy, but it isn&#8217;t really to my taste &#8211; it has a very strong aftertaste yet is lacking in any interesting fruity flavours.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are plenty of other things I&#8217;d rather drink before picking this.

Jocelyn says: &#8220;Damn, I&#8217;ve dripped it on my top, I&#8217;ll have to wash this now.&#8221;
