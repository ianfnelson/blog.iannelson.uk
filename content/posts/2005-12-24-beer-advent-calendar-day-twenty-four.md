Hertog Jan Doppio Double is the only one of my twenty-four Advent beers to come in a stone cork-stoppered bottle that weighs more than the drink contained within! At 7.3% ABV, it&#8217;s also the [second-strongest][1] drink in my selection, and hence has a real kick to it.&nbsp; That said, it also has a gorgeous malty aroma, and strong aftertaste which beer lovers will appreciate.&nbsp; So whilst it&#8217;s not quite my [personal favourite][2] of the twenty-four beers I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of sampling this yuletide, it&#8217;s certainly an appropriately worthy and warming drink on which to finish.

I&#8217;ve been asked to summarise my findings on these beers at the end of the season, and was considering publishing a spreadsheet noting my opinions in various categories (colour, aroma, aftertaste, strength, packaging, cute names&#8230;), but having consumed so many fine ales this month, it was beyond me to come up with such a complicated scoring system.&nbsp; Instead, I&#8217;ve made an effort to merely triage the beers according to my overall opinion and likelihood of repurchase &#8211; those with three stars will be on our shopping list in future, whilst those with one star will be avoided like the plague.
