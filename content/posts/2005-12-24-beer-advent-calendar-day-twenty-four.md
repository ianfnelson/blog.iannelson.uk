Hertog Jan Doppio Double is the only one of my twenty-four Advent beers to come in a stone cork-stoppered bottle that weighs more than the drink contained within! At 7.3% ABV, it’s also the [second-strongest][1] drink in my selection, and hence has a real kick to it.&nbsp; That said, it also has a gorgeous malty aroma, and strong aftertaste which beer lovers will appreciate.&nbsp; So whilst it’s not quite my [personal favourite][2] of the twenty-four beers I’ve had the pleasure of sampling this yuletide, it’s certainly an appropriately worthy and warming drink on which to finish.

I’ve been asked to summarise my findings on these beers at the end of the season, and was considering publishing a spreadsheet noting my opinions in various categories (colour, aroma, aftertaste, strength, packaging, cute names&#8230;), but having consumed so many fine ales this month, it was beyond me to come up with such a complicated scoring system.&nbsp; Instead, I’ve made an effort to merely triage the beers according to my overall opinion and likelihood of repurchase &#8211; those with three stars will be on our shopping list in future, whilst those with one star will be avoided like the plague.
