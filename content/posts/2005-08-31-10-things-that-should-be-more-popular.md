Some days I feel like I’m spitting in the wind. It amazes me that the following ten concepts, websites and applications aren’t more widely used:

  1. [RSS Feeds][1] &#8211; why waste your time repeatedly trawling dozens of sites looking for new content?&nbsp; Let it come to you!
  2. [Flickr][2] &#8211; practically everyone I know has a digital camera, but still relatively few have a Flickr account. Share your photos, don’t keep them unseen on your hard drive!
  3. [GMail][3] &#8211; by far the most effective web-based email.
  4. [FireFox][4] &#8211; if only for the tabbed browsing. But really, it’s so much nicer than IE6, and a myriad of different extensions are available.
  5. [OneNote][5] &#8211; so much better than scraps of paper.
  6. [Desktop Search][6] &#8211; I don’t care [which][7] [desktop][8] [search][9] [program][10] you use, but please install one!&nbsp; You’ll find it so much easier to find old emails and other files.
  7. [del.icio.us][11] &#8211; access your bookmarks anywhere, and share them with friends.
  8. [ClearType][12] &#8211; if you have a flatscreen monitor, you should turn ClearType on. Period.
  9. [Virtual PC][13] &#8211; there’s no need to test beta software on your main machine, or keep several differently-configured computers around the house any more!
 10. [SyncToy][14] &#8211; this is a great little app for synchronizing and backing-up folders; it’s really useful for combining media folders, and for synching files with a portable hard drive.
