Today was a proud day indeed. Remember four years ago when I [blogged about Jocelyn getting a fiancee visa from the British Consulate in Los Angeles][1], which paved the way for her to travel to Blighty with the intention of marrying me..?<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">

Well, since then we’ve turned that fiancee visa into a limited leave visa, and then into a settlement visa. We have spent over £2000 on government fees for these various rubber stamps &#8211; outrageously high amounts which resulted in letters being sent [to][2] and [from][3] the Home Office. Along the way, we got married, [moved house][4], and of course [Benjamin][5] came along to change our lives forever (in a good way, of course, Son!).

But I’m proud to report that today Jocelyn collected a certificate of naturalisation from Peter Sowray, Chairman of North Yorkshire County Council, granting her full British Citizenship.<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">

She has already put this dual nationality to good use, by this evening registering to vote in both the UK and the US! Good on ya, wifey!
