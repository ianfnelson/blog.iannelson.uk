This is surely one of the best ideas I’ve ever had! I’ve followed through with my plan to buy twenty-four beers from around the world to count down the days until Christmas. Their names are all written on slips of folded paper in a small vase (nobody actually draws things out of a hat anymore, do they?).

Today I’m enjoying **[Young’s Christmas Pudding Ale][1]**, which is 5.5% ABV according to the bottle but only 5.0% according to the website—don’t believe everything you read on the web, eh?

The tasting notes say:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    With its warming, dark ruby character and the splendid luscious flavour of dried fruit, Young’s Christmas Pudding Ale is an inspirational addition to any Christmas feast or fireside gathering.
  </p>

I say it’s tasty—pleasant as a singleton but probably a bit too fruity for a prolonged sesh. It really does smell like figgy pudding, too!

If this were a track on my iPod, I’d probably give it four stars.

Jocelyn says: “Huh? I can’t taste any fruit. Nope, tastes like beer to me. I’d prefer a Guinness.”

I wonder what tomorrow will bring…
