My contract with NHS England has come to an abrupt end sooner than expected following a _narrowing of focus_ within the Digital Prevention Services Portfolio. The team I was leading — designing and building components of a National Screening Platform — has been stood down. The work: making legacy health data interoperable and event-driven, surfacing screening journeys in the mighty NHS App, and integrating with ageing systems that only whispered their secrets under moonlight. Standard stuff.

As a result, I'm now available for a new contract from **Tuesday 17 June 2025**.

## What I Do

I'm a Technical Lead, Architect and Developer with nearly three decades of experience delivering backend-heavy, cloud-native high-availability systems.

I specialise in:

- Distributed architectures
- Messaging and event-driven design
- API integration (REST and otherwise)
- Systems that survive contact with the real world

I've worked across public health, finance and regulation, acquisition-driven rebuilds, and platforms serving millions. I've led teams through:

- Agile delivery in high-pressure environments
- Architecture design and review
- Production support and incident handling
- Interviewing and capability-building
- CI/CD workflows, pairing, mentoring, and the occasional polite argument about naming things

My current toolkit includes:

- **Azure** (Function Apps, Service Bus, Cosmos DB, SQL Server)
- **AWS** (Lambda, Step Functions, SQS, API Gateway, Dynamo DB)
- **Languages:** C# 1-13, Java 8-21
- **Patterns**: Messaging, pub/sub, retries, idempotency, automation, DevOps, microservice orchestration and choreography
- **Delivery**: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Jenkins, TeamCity, Planning Poker if I must

## What I'm Looking For

- Contract roles
- Remote-first (Yorkshire-based but flexible)
- Teams who value quality, autonomy, and making things that last
- Work that has _consequence_ - whether public, regulatory, or commercial

I work best when:

- Things are ambiguous but important
- Systems are complicated, but someone needs to make them _understandable_
- There's a team that cares, and a goal that's worth the effort
- There's still some room for humour, even on release days

## What You Get

- A seasoned hand who can design it, build it, lead it, and fix it
- Someone who still writes code and cares about clean abstractions
- Judgement earned the hard way - through years of legacy horror, cloud nuance, and projects that had both
- A teammate who'll mentor juniors, challenge architects, and never, ever, suggest Kubernetes unless it's absolutely necessary

If you've got something worth building, debugging, modernising, or rescuing — I'm all ears. Let's talk.
