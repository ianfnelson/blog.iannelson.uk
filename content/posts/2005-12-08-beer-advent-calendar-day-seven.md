Wednesday night&#8217;s tipple was the rather strange 5% ABV [Kronenbourg Blanc][1], from UK brewing giant [Scottish & Newcastle][2].  Described as a &#8220;refreshing, fruity white beer&#8221;, this is in fact blatantly piss-coloured (which probably explains why it comes in an opaque bottle).  I found this to be more reminiscent of a weak cider or some kind of bizarre citrus alcopop than anything deserving to have the word &#8220;beer&#8221; on the label.  Still, try everything once except Morris Dancing and incest, as the saying goes.

Jocelyn says: &#8220;This is a girly beer!  I could drink this!  This is fruity, it&#8217;s not a beer at all!&#8221;

Weird advertising, too &#8211; would you buy a drink for this girl?<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
