What’s on your desktop background?  Some bland corporate logo perhaps, or maybe one of the bog-standard Windows wallpapers, or maybe a photograph you took years ago?  
Let’s face it, when was the last time you changed your background?  Wouldn’t it be great if you could specify a few keywords and have your background periodically change to show a new image courtesy of Flickr?  Say, a sunrise, a mountain, a wintry scene, a favourite holiday destination, or, well, whatever takes your fancy?

This is exactly what [John’s Background Switcher][1] (version 2.0!) does, and it’s available for free right now.  I’ve had the pleasure of beta-testing this over the past few weeks, and it really does work!  I used to claim that I needed two screens for the productivity benefits, but now I find myself devoting one of them to cheering my day with regularly changing pictures courtesy of JBS.  Perhaps this is a good time to try recycling one of our old laptops as a digital photo frame?!
