Having accepted that [Returning DataSets from WebServices is the Spawn of Satan and Represents All That Is Truly Evil in the World][1] (or at least, not exactly best practice), Iâ€™ve been trying to make a conscious effort to instead use lightweight custom objects in my middle tier, to be exposed via web services for use by other applications. I felt sure that some of the new Generic classes in the .NET 2.0 FCL would help me in my quest. Specifically, as I often need to expose simple arrays of Key/Value Pair metadata, I planned to create an instance of the&nbsp; System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection class, containing a bunch of System.Collections.Generic.KeyValuePair objects.&nbsp;

Well, this all seemed to go to plan, and worked just fine within my app. But when I exposed the method as a web service, I discovered that neither the Key nor the Value properties were serialized â€“ I was left to consume a lovely generic collection of objects with no members â€“ not a whole lot of use.

A little Googling turned up [this blog entry][2], which explains that the Key and Value properties on the KeyValuePair class are both read-only, and by design the XmlSerializer will not serialize properties that donâ€™t have a set accessor!

Damned if that little matter was going to stop me, I whipped out my copy of Lutz Roederâ€™s reflector to reverse engineer the KeyValuePair class (to be honest, I could have guessed most of it), and added a <span style="font-style: italic;">private</span> set accessor to both properties, thus persuading the XmlSerializer to, well, do some serializing ðŸ™‚

Hereâ€™s the code for this new class:



Having done that, to add a little clarity when using this class in the way I anticipate and eliminate repeated code, I decided to create some specific versions of the Collection, ReadOnlyCollection and KeyedCollection classes:
