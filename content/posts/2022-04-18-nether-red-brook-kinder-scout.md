Another enjoyable day out scrambling with my daughter Isla.

The scramble itself is part of Route 27 in [_Scrambles In The Dark Peak_ by Tom Corker and Terry Sleaford][1]. A wander along the north-western edge of the Kinder Scout plateau afforded some impressive views across to Manchester. We joined the Pennine Way for a short while, before heading back down the Snake Path.
