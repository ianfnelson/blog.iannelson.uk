Proudly presenting a new addition to the family – Mr Matthew Henry Nelson:

He arrived at 0624 local time on the morning of Saturday 1st September, and weighed in at 7 pounds 6 ounces. This was 17 days sooner than expected, and his early arrival literally caught his Daddy napping – while Jocelyn was giving birth in York, I was sleeping soundly in a Reading Novotel ahead of the [DDD10 conference][1]. Needless to say, when I woke to find eight missed calls, a voicemail, text message, and even posts on my FaceBook wall trying to alert me to Matthew’s imminent arrival, I decided to give the conference a miss and head quickly back up the M1.
