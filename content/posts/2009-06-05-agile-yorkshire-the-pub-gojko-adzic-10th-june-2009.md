If you’re in the Leeds area next Wednesday, why not come along to this Agile Yorkshire session?

> ## 10th June – Gojko Adzic: Slim, The Future Of FitNesse
>
> ### Details
>
> This talk will introduce Slim, the most important upgrade to [FitNesse][1] in years. Slim is the new test runner which promises to bring platform interoperability, easier integration, a much simpler programming model and lots of small helpers that will allow us to write and maintain executable specifications and acceptance tests easier. This is a session for .NET and Java developers. Some prior exposure to FitNesse and FIT would be beneficial, but not required.
