At first glance it all looks very impressive, but closer inspection of the comparison with sales of the Torygraph reveal a mere 8.7% sales lead, not more than double as suggested by the graphic.&nbsp; Not fooled.

Another favourite book of mine that covers the still-relevant topic of graphical integrity is Edward Tufte’s _[The Visual Display of Quantitative Information][2]_<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=ianesbl-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0961392142" alt="" border="0" height="1" width="1" />.&nbsp; It’s one of those timeless works that I look forward to sharing with the next generation.
