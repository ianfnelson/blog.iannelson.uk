_Monday 10th April 2006</p> 

</i>Travelling West during the daytime is a blast, especially on a sunny day.&nbsp; Time it right and you can experience daylight for 24 hours, which afforded me time to catch up on some reading.&nbsp; For Christmas Joce had given a book entitled [Freakonomics &#8211; A Rogue Economist Explores The Hidden Side Of Eveything][1], and now I finally had time to read through it.&nbsp; I surprised myself by finishing it by the time we reached Chicago &#8211; this may be a chunky hardback book on economics, but it’s also _really_ interesting and easy-going.

The book answers a mixed bag of questions &#8211; Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? &#8211; by using standard economic tools.&nbsp; The results are fascinating &#8211; go check out some [chapter excerpts][2] on the website if you don’t believe me.

Anyway, that book, combined with Barney, my trusty iPod made the flights, well, fly by.&nbsp; It was the first time I’ve travelled whilst carrying almost my entire music collection in my pocket, and having that level of choice really pleased me.&nbsp; Previously, no matter how many tapes or CDs I carried, there would always be something left at home that I had a desperate urge to listen to, and I never seemed to have the music to match my mood &#8211; which is [essential for an INTP][3].

At O’Hare airport, we discovered a small advantage of our transatlantic marriage &#8211; we can choose to go through passport control together through either the "citizens" or "foreigners" queue (natually, we picked the shorter one), in order to provide a complete picture to the immigration officer.&nbsp; The time savings we gained here were, however, subsequently lost when we inadvertantly picked up the wrong suitcase at baggage reclaim &#8211; I ask you, what are the chances of somebody else having the exact same model of case, _and_ tying a blue ribbon around the handle to make it more easily identifiable?&nbsp; Less minimal than we expected, evidently&#8230;
