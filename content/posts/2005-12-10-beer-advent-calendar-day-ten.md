Ah, I do enjoy beers by the [Wychwood Brewery][1], who have a particularly good website (i.e. better than most of the brewery sites I’ve come across so far).  Hobgoblin is an obvious favourite, easily available from any supermarket worth its salt.  Today I sampled their [Whirlygig][2] ale, a 4.5% &#8220;frenzy of hops and malt&#8221;, which really is delicious.  Lots of flavour, lots of character &#8211; very enjoyable indeed.  This one goes into the &#8220;buy again&#8221; column.  Jocelyn didn’t get a look in, so I can’t give you the female opinion, sorry.
