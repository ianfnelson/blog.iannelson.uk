Good Friday, 10th April 1998.

While the [Good Friday Agreement][1] was being signed in Belfast, I was reluctantly plodding up my first ever Munro, the dreary featureless lump that is [Meall a’Chrasgaidh][2].

Only the view across to the mighty [An Teallach][3] served to convince me that it was perhaps worth giving this hillwalking lark another try.
