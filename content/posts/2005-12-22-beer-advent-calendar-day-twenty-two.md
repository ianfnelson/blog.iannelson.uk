[Fraoch][1] is a 5% ABV Scottish beer that brings back many happy memories of late nights spent in the bar at the [Clachaig Inn][2].  &#8220;Fraoch&#8221; is the Gaelic for heather, so take a guess what this beer is made from?  If you’ve never tried it, that might sound a bit weird, but believe me that this is a great beer with &#8220;a floral, peaty aroma, full malt body, spicy herbal flavour and a dry wine like finish&#8221;.  What more could you ask for?  Slainte!
