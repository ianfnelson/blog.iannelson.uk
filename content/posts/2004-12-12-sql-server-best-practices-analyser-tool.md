Via [Eric G. Harrison][1] &#8211; MS have developed a [SQL Server Best Practices Analyser Tool][2]. It&#8217;s like a cross between [FxCop][3] and [Baseline Security Analyser][4], for SQL Server. Very useful. I just downloaded it, ran it against some of my databases, and it made some useful suggestions. This could quickly become indispensable.
