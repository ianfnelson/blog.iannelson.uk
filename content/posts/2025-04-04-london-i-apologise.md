For most of my adult life, in a way typical of those of us from the North, I have disdained London.

Too big. Too busy. Too smug. Too... *London*. I’ve long maintained that its gravitational pull distorts the rest of the country, and that one’s quality of life improves in direct proportion to one’s distance from Zone 1.

And yet — I am beginning to suspect that, deep down, behind my carefully-curated facade, I really rather like it.

It started innocently enough: a team away day, one of those softly-mandated pilgrimages to headquarters. The sort of day filled with icebreakers (Lord help me),  and colleagues sketching their superhero alter-egos (naturally). But something about it all — the spring sunshine, the civility of strangers answering my dumb questions on the tube, the sheer *pleasantness* of the whole affair — began to crack my cynicism.

The train journey down there was full but tolerable. I even forgave the freeze-dried coffee sachet (£2.50, thanks LNER) and found unexpected delight in the rhythm of Audible piped through noise-cancelling headphones. I listened to Tony Blair musing on technocracy and health reform. The irony was not lost on me.

We gathered in a sleek office somewhere in Canary Wharf and talked about six-week software cycles and data integration. It should have been excruciating. But it wasn’t. It was... *fine*. I met a bright twenty-something who knew his stuff and didn’t make me feel ancient. I had a mini sushi box that I dearly wished had been a maxi. I bonded over high-level architecture diagrams and event-driven dreams.

Later, in the pub (where I eked out two £7.85 pints), I traded gossip and shots with colleagues I had previously only seen in pixelated form. At some point, without quite noticing, I found myself thinking: this is nice.

Two hours later, back on the train with a £7.49 Cornish pasty and aching legs, I declared it aloud: *I have decided to like London now.*

It’s only two hours from Selby. The Elizabeth Line exists. The people — heaven help me — are making an effort. Even the pasty wasn’t terrible.

And so, London, I offer you this: a retraction. Not quite an apology I suppose, and certainly not a love letter. But a grudging acknowledgment that I’ve changed my mind. You’re alright. Let’s not get carried away.
