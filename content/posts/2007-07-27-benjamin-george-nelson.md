It gives me unparalleled joy to announce the birth of Mr Benjamin George Nelson.

Following a relatively swift labour, the new arrival entered the world suddenly at York Hospital on Wednesday at 22:24 local time ([see this time in your time zone][1]).

Birth mass was 4.185 kilograms (9 pounds 3 ounces), length was 51 centimetres (20 inches).<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
