My daughter Isla pronounced [our April walk up Pen-y-Ghent][1] to have been “a bit boring”. Apparently she enjoyed the scrambling and the views but not the lengthy slog. Fair enough.

So, looking for something more interesting for our next Dad and Daughter trip into the hills, I armed myself with a copy of “[Scrambles In The Dark Peak][2]” by Terry Sleaford and Tom Corker, and today we set off to tackle the first route in the book.

Starting at a lay-by high on Saddleworth Moor, we dropped down into Rimmon Pit Clough, before scrambling up again to the Raven Stones and The Trinnacle.

The route back to the road was mostly a gradual climb across open moorland – tiring work for middle-aged legs that made the overall walk feel much longer than its eight kilometres!
