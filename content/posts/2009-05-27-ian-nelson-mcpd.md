Well, for the record, I passed MS exam 70-553 yesterday on my second attempt, which makes me a Microsoft Certified Professional Developer – Enterprise Application Developer:<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">

And I also acquired a few new MCTS certifications as a happy by-product:<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">

My full transcript, including “legacy” certifications, is [here][1].

Phew! I think that the time has now come for me to take a bit of a break from the certification circus. They are a nice-to-have, but the opportunity cost is too high – there are many other ways in which I can spend what little spare time I have to better develop my skills.
