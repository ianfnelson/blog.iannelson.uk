I am now a Microsoft Certified Solution Developer in .NET 1.x technologies. This is a qualification that I&#8217;ve been working towards on and (more often than not) off for the past four years or so. It&#8217;s not really the case that the exams were super-hard, just that it took occasional motivation to get round to taking them!

So, was it worth it?&nbsp; Did I learn anything en route?&nbsp; Did the exams boost my employability?&nbsp; Would I be more inclined to employ someone with an MCSD than an applicant without?

Stepping back in time a little, my first real conversation about .Net was in November 2000, at a job interview for a position with [ioko][1]{.} (then Infocom), when [Matthew][2]{.} asked me something vague along the lines of &#8220;what did I understand regarding Microsoft&#8217;s .NET initiative?&#8221;&nbsp; I honestly can&#8217;t remember my answer, but it can&#8217;t have utterly sucked as I got the job, and started the following month.

A year later, December 2001, and I attended&nbsp;the two-day .NET launch at the London Hilton, at which a certain Bill Gates gave a keynote speech explaining why .NET was the future. It was one of the few sessions at that conference which didn&#8217;t go over my head &#8211; the rest utterly blew my mind, and made me feel extremely ignorant &#8211; me with my VB6 and ASP3 skills!

Another year passed, and a quiet market meant that I still hadn&#8217;t had any opportunity to cut my teeth on any .NET projects. But crucially (and&nbsp;in retrospect foolishly), I also hadn&#8217;t put any personal effort into learning these important new technologies. So, on 3rd December 2002, I ordered some self-study books for exams 70-315 and 70-316. Apparently expecting to learn by osmosis, I then popped them on my bookshelf, and headed off to Australia to visit my friends Bruce and Suzanne.

When I got back from Down Under, in January 2003, my job at ioko was not waiting for me. That quiet market wasn&#8217;t getting any noisier, a cull had to occur, and, since I didn&#8217;t have any proven .Net skills&#8230;

Redundancy wasn&#8217;t&nbsp;a pleasant experience, and I wanted to get back into the world of work ASAP (after all, the mortgage wasn&#8217;t going to pay itself), so I quickly took up what I always expected to be a stop-gap VB6/ASP job &#8211; the pay wasn&#8217;t great but it beat daytime TV, spamming the employment agencies and constantly refreshing jobserve.com. It was at this point in time I realised that the only person with the capability to improve my skills and career prospects was myself. For too long I had equated career success to &#8220;luck&#8221; in being placed on the right projects. Now it was time for me to invest some time and energy learning those all-important .NET skills that I&#8217;d been reading about for the past few years.

For much of the long hot summer of 2003, I burnt the midnight oil developing a three-tier web application for the investment club of which I was the treasurer at that time. This served a number of purposes:&nbsp; Of course, the website was useful to those who had access to it, but more importantly to me, it provided a way to develop the .NET skills that I saw as being the keys to a better job. Now, the obvious shortcoming of using a personal project as a way to learn a set of technologies is that you&#8217;re unlikely to stumble across those enterprise-y features in the Framework that are of particular use in business scenarios. So, I supplemented my late-night hacking sessions (which incidentally resulted in my neighbours complaining about my playing pop music at 2am) with some diligent studying of the 70-306 guide that I&#8217;d bought the previous winter. On 14th June 2003, after spending around Â£80 of my own cash to take the exam, I passed that test, becoming an MCP for the first time.

Was it worth it?&nbsp; I think so. My efforts meant I got a good grounding in aspects of the technologies that I would not otherwise have stumbled across, and it gave me something concrete and .NET-related to put on my CV (effectively saying &#8220;yeah, I know I haven&#8217;t worked with these technologies professionally, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t understand them&#8221;). A few months later, as the market started to gradually pick up again, I got the job I still have &#8211; as a .NET developer for Marshalls. I&#8217;ve no doubt that the MCP exam helped to at least get my foot in the door.

I took the remaining four exams at my leisure over the next few years. Whilst studying for the SQL Server (70-229), Web Services and Server Components (70-320) and Requirements and Architectures (70-300) exams, I always found myself learning several things that I hadn&#8217;t picked up on the job &#8211; in that sense at least, I think undertaking the exams was worthwhile. The final exam I took was the Windows App exam (70-316), and this was a bit of a stroll in all honesty, after the previous four exams and three year&#8217;s of .NET experience.

Would I be more inclined to employ someone with an MCSD than an applicant without?&nbsp; I think the qualification helps greatly in identifying potential candidates, but there are many other factors that make a good developer that aren&#8217;t covered in any depth by these exams. Design Patterns and OOP concepts in general were not really tested, even on the 70-300 exam. Knowledge of IIS was not covered on 70-306 &#8211; I guess it&#8217;s assumed that this is the realm of the Systems Administrator rather than the coder, but in reality (especially in small teams), a good ASP.NET developer needs an intimate understanding of how their web server works and is configured. What about covering topics such as source control, automated builds, and release management?&nbsp; Issues such as unit testing and the benefits of code reviews were mentioned in the 70-300 exam, but there&#8217;s a difference between knowing the theory and applying this in practice. An MCSD qualification certainly demonstrates the former, but a few searching questions at interview are still required to prove the latter.

So what&#8217;s next for me?&nbsp; Upgrading to the &#8220;[MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer][3]&#8221; qualification is the obvious path, and I&#8217;ll probably do so in due course, but right now I&#8217;d like to like to spend more time getting to grips with SQL Server 2005 by taking the relevant [MCTS exam (70-431)][4]. If that goes well, then maybe I&#8217;ll continue onto the [MCITP: DB Dev][5] qualification. We&#8217;ll see.
