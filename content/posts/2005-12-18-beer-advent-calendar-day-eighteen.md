There’s something a wee bit disappointing about picking up a bottle labelled &#8220;MOROCCO ALE&#8221; and finding that it is, in fact, from nowhere more distant than Harrogate &#8211; the Daleside Brewery to be precise.  According to the label:

> &#8220;The recipe for Morocco Ale is believed to date from Elizabethan times.  Colonel John Grahme of Levens was a courtier to James II and the name &#8216;Morocco’ may have been associated with the dark Moors who came to the court when Catherine of Braganza married Charles II and brought Tangiers as part of her dowry.&#8221;

Right.  Whatever.  Apparently this 5.5% beer is brewed to an ancient secret recipe, so it’s curious that it tastes so strongly of rosemary.  I mean, not just a little hint of the stuff, this really could conceivably be nothing more than fermented rosemary, the taste is so overwhelming.  Which is certainly different, but I’m not sure it’s really my thing.

Six beers to go &#8211; wonder what tomorrow will bring?
