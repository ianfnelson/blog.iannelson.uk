There&#8217;s something a wee bit disappointing about picking up a bottle labelled &#8220;MOROCCO ALE&#8221; and finding that it is, in fact, from nowhere more distant than Harrogate &#8211; the Daleside Brewery to be precise.  According to the label:

> &#8220;The recipe for Morocco Ale is believed to date from Elizabethan times.  Colonel John Grahme of Levens was a courtier to James II and the name &#8216;Morocco&#8217; may have been associated with the dark Moors who came to the court when Catherine of Braganza married Charles II and brought Tangiers as part of her dowry.&#8221;

Right.  Whatever.  Apparently this 5.5% beer is brewed to an ancient secret recipe, so it&#8217;s curious that it tastes so strongly of rosemary.  I mean, not just a little hint of the stuff, this really could conceivably be nothing more than fermented rosemary, the taste is so overwhelming.  Which is certainly different, but I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s really my thing.

Six beers to go &#8211; wonder what tomorrow will bring?
