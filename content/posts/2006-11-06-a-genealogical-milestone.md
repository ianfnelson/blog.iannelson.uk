Late last night I reached a small but significant milestone in my family tree research:&nbsp; I now know the names of my sixteen great-great-grandparents!&nbsp; Or so I believe &#8211; I just need to wait for a couple of certificates to arrive from the GRO to prove my theories.

So, who do I think I am?&nbsp; Well, at this stage it appears that my blood is:

  * 50.0% English
  * 37.5% Scottish
  * 12.5% Irish

Those sixteen ancestors were born between 1829 and 1860.

I haven’t yet updated my [online family tree][1], but will do so later today.

I suspect that this marks the end of the "easy bit" of my research, and doubt that I’ll ever succeed in discovering the names of all of my 32 great-great-great-grandparents.&nbsp; Still, you never know&#8230;
