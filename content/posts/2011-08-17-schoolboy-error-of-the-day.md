This dumb mistake just cost me an hour spelunking around in the debugger:

<pre><code class="language-clike">var status = source.Substring(source.LastIndexOf("/" + 1));  </code></pre>

(where source is e.g. &#8220;<http://foo.com/status/all-is-good>&#8220;)

Fortunately the ramifications were picked up in the acceptance tests, but the root cause wasnâ€™t at all obvious from such a high level.

Lesson for the day &#8211; code is never too trivial to warrant unit testing.
