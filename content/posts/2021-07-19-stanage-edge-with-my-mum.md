Iâ€™m on a break between contracts this week, so decided to make the most of the good weather and headed into the Peak District to revisit [Stanage Edge][1] for the first time since 2000.

Unlike [my last visit twenty years ago][2], there were no ropes or belays involved this time. Instead my Mum and I had a leisurely wander in the blistering July sunshine up part of the [Long Causeway][3], before taking some snapshots at the latest version of the historic [Stanage Pole][4].
