As I mentioned [last summer][1], I do enjoy whiling away a few hours attempting to solve the maths / progamming challenges set on [Project Euler][2]. My language of choice for most puzzles is C#, but this hampered me on some of the questions as there is no in-built support for really big integers.

However, a little bit of Googling and I came across this excellent [BigInteger class][3] on Code Project which does everything I need and more – and it seems bloody fast, too. Thanks to this class, I’ve been able to knock off several more problems this weekend, and now have a rating of “11% Genius” – still some way to go, then&#8230;
