So, base rates are now down to 1.0%, and the [Zero Interest Bug][1] is not just conjecture.

From [The Times][2]:

> “About 1,500 customers who took out a tracker mortgages pegged at 1.01 points below the base rate with Cheltenham & Gloucester (C&G), owned by Lloyds Banking Group, will be paying no interest at all on their home loans from next month.
>
> It is the first time that a mortgage lender has been forced to reduce the interest on their home loans to zero.
> Lloyds Banking Group, now 43 per cent owned by the taxpayer and also the owner of C&G, said that there was a zero floor to the deal and that **because its computer systems could not cope with zero**, it would be temporarily charging 0.001 per cent, or 8p a month for a borrower with a £100,000 mortgage. However, that money will be refunded.”

I bet those jammy 1,500 people are feeling quite smug today. Needless to say, I’m still kicking myself very hard for fixing my mortgage last summer… sob!
