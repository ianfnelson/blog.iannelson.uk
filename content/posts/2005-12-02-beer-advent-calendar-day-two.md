Well, this evening’s advent beer couldn’t be more different from yesterday’s. I had the dubious pleasure of sampling <a href="http://www.chilibeer.com/" data-type="link" data-id="http://www.chilibeer.com/">Crazy Ed’s Cave Creek Chili Beer,</a> all the way from Arizona.

Be warned: the website dates from 1999, and boy, does it show—we’re talking Comic Sans in a scrolling&nbsp;<marquee>&nbsp;tag, framesets that have a tendency to get confused (try clicking the “home” link), and a 53-kilopixel JPEG weighing in at an astonishing 232 KB (why?!). Seeing those “Netscape Now!” animated GIFs makes me all nostalgic for the twentieth century…

_Ahem._&nbsp;But enough about the site—what about the beer? Well, it was a lucky choice for this evening, as Joce had made Mexican for dinner. It was certainly spicy (with a whole chili pod in the bottle), but to be honest, I would have preferred a nice, refreshing Corona or Sol. As with yesterday’s offering, this was a fun novelty drink as a one-off, but not something I could happily sup all evening.

Joce says: “Oh! Ow! Oh my God! Oh, man! That is the hottest thing I’ve ever tasted! My throat is on fire!”
