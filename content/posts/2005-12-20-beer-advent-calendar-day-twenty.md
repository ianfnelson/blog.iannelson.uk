Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong, there are many great things that have originated from America &#8211; not least of all my good lady wife &#8211; but I&#8217;ve always thought that &#8220;American Beer&#8221; is something of an anachronism!  Let&#8217;s face it, most beers from across the Altlantic are sorely lacking in flavour, body, bitterness, or, well, anything remotely beerlike.  So, whilst on my search for twenty-four bottled beers for this advent calendar, I was intrigued to find Honker&#8217;s Ale from the [Goose Island Beer Company][1] in Chicago which describes itself as &#8220;a smooth, drinkable English bitter for those drinkers who want more from their beer&#8221;.  Well, let&#8217;s hope they&#8217;re not looking for too much more, as it only comes in a 355ml bottle.  It tastes OK when compared to the likes of Budweiser and Samuel Adams, but it&#8217;s not exactly bold or challenging, and the whole experience was over far too quickly.  Not exactly one to savour on a cold winter&#8217;s night in Yorkshire, but I can imagine these going down quite well in the sports stadia of Iliinois.
