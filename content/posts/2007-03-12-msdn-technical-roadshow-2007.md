I&#8217;m off to the [MSDN Technical roadshow][1] in Harrogate tomorrow, and am actually really looking forward to it this time. These events are free, so always well worth attending when they&#8217;re local, but some years are certainly better than others &#8211; it mostly depends on the material being covered. I remember one year circa 2003-4, when .NET was well established, but before the Whidbey release, so the majority of the day was effectively just a sales pitch covering elementary .NET concepts, presumably for those laggards who hadn&#8217;t yet made the great leap from VB6. Another data-binding demo, anybody?&nbsp; Yawn.

By contrast, this time round there&#8217;s no shortage of exciting potential topics, and as I&#8217;ve mentioned recently, I&#8217;ve been having difficulty making time to get stuck into learning some of the new technologies that are on the horizon. So the opportunity of a day out watching some powerpoint presentations, demos, and trying to soak up an understanding of this stuff really appeals to me &#8211; is that sad?!

The two sessions I&#8217;m most looking forward to are [Daniel Moth][2] covering LINQ and other forthcoming language enhancements in the Orcas release, and [Mike Ormond][3]&#8216;s session on AJAX development. Should be good.

Oh, entertainingly, someone found my blog this week by Googling for [&#8220;msdn event&#8221; dress code][4] &#8211; my advice is to go casual; stick to the usual geek staples of t-shirt with jeans or combats and you can&#8217;t go far wrong!
