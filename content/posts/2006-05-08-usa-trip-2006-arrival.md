_Monday 10th April 2006_

The sun was still shining as we touched down at SFO, about 22 hours after we&#8217;d woken up.&nbsp; If every day could last that long, I swear I&#8217;d get more work done &#8211; or maybe I&#8217;d just spend more time playing [Civilization][1]&#8230;

We picked up the car &#8211; a Pontiac Impala which initially seemed unfeasibly huge compared to our Focus, but it&#8217;s funny how quickly you adjust and get used to the size, making use of the available space &#8211; then it was off down US 101 on the final leg of our journey.&nbsp; Despite it being rush hour, we had a swift journey due to being able to use the Car Pool lane (by virtue of not being a single-occupant vehicle).&nbsp; I was amazed how under-utilised this lane was, and started wondering how much of an incentive would be needed for more Bay area commuters to start sharing rides &#8211; there&#8217;s another good question for [the economists][2] to ponder.

Joce drove &#8211; I didn&#8217;t think it prudent for my first transatlantic driving experience to come during rush hour at the end of a long day&#8217;s travelling &#8211; and I gazed out of the window, musing again at the open, opportune feeling of the region, despite its large population.&nbsp; There are new buildings springing up, visible signs of affluence, and it all combines to create the feeling (illusion?) that anything is possible, there&#8217;s no history to hold back your dreams.&nbsp; And of course, as a professional software developer, I was very aware of the kind of businesses to be found in cities such as Mountain View, Sunnyvale, and Palo Alto, that we sped through.

Back home, there&#8217;s something about York &#8211; the wealth of history, the cramped streets maybe &#8211; that convinces me that it&#8217;s nigh-on impossible to get noticed or make an impact in such a city.&nbsp; How can you make your mark in a city with so many Roman remains on every street corner?&nbsp; There&#8217;s always a nagging feeling that someone got there first, that it&#8217;s all been done before.&nbsp; Name some famous people who&#8217;ve made an impact in York?&nbsp; [Ivar the Boneless][3]?&nbsp; [John Sentamu][4]?&nbsp; [Dame Judi Dench][5]?&nbsp; [Rick Witter][6]&#8230;?&nbsp; I hypothesised that this might partly explain the large number of Guilds, Companies, Lodges, Fraternities and Clubs in the city &#8211; people band together in an effort to attain power and influence.&nbsp; Is there a Company of Merchant Adventurers in North California?&nbsp; I suspect not.

I shared my musings with Jocelyn.&nbsp; She said "Well&#8230; what sort of an impact would you like to make?"&nbsp; I confessed that I didn&#8217;t have the foggiest idea.&nbsp; She rightly suggested that maybe it would be a good idea to decide that first, and worry about geography later.
