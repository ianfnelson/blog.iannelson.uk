I keep intending, and forgetting to post a couple of videos from our US holiday last April.  I suppose I was hoping to get round to writing up my paper notes from the holiday, but it&#8217;s becoming apparent that won&#8217;t happen anytime soon, so let&#8217;s skip forward to the funny bits:

We spent a couple of nights at the Stratosphere Hotel in Las Vegas, which is the tallest observation tower in the United States.  Atop the tower are three &#8220;thrill rides&#8221;, and I foolishly tried all of them whilst Jocelyn videoed proceedings from a safe distance.

The Big Shot, at 329m high is the highest ride in the world.  This is essentially a big pole with seats around the side that flings you straight up, quickly, and drops you down again.  You&#8217;ve probably seen these elsewhere, this is much the same except it happens to be on the top of a very tall building and hence offers mighty fine views over the Las Vegas desert.  We don&#8217;t have any video of this as it all happened a bit too quickly for Joce to catch.

X-Scream, at 264m high is the third highest ride in the world.  This is basically a glorified bench that dangles off the edge of the building, and it is one of the scariest things I&#8217;ve ever experienced!  From inside the building Jocelyn captured the video below &#8211; turn up the volume to hear some Aussie tourists laughing at my predicament!<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure> 

Insanity, at 274m high is the second highest ride in the world.  According to Wikipedia, &#8220;it dangles riders over the edge of the tower and then spins in a circular pattern at approximately forty miles per hour&#8221;.  This was also pretty scary, though the constant circular motion made it less terrifying than the X-Scream (with its stop-start &#8220;aha, you thought you were going to continue falling for another 100+ storeys&#8221; shenanigans).  Here&#8217;s a video of me on the Insanity &#8211; can&#8217;t think why I&#8217;m the only partipant&#8230;<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"></figure> <figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide">
