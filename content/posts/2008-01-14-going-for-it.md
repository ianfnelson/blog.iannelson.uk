I’ve never been a fan of those [motivational posters][1] that you see on office walls (usually in sales or marketing departments) that attempt to depict a word like “Opportunity” or “Teamwork” with a single image, usual of some nature scene or a lone individual rising above the odds to achieve a difficult goal. To my mind they always look a bit facile, glib and superficial. “Destiny” equates to a holiday villa on the Maldives?  “Integrity” is a Lion? “Success” appears to involve hang-gliding off towards the ocean in an action which brings to mind Reginald Perrin?! I demand more thought and more words from my motivational office decorations!

For many many years, blu-tacked to my monitor at home has been an [inspirational “wallet stuffer” by Bruce B. Wilmer][2] which was given to me by my mum. It’s a short poem entitled “Go For It!” which begins:

> “Shake off your doubts and then go for it.  
> Check out your options and act.  
> Find an approach to the future,  
> And turn today’s dreams into fact.”  

I’ve seen those words on a daily basis for far too long. Today is the day that I stop simply reading them, and start acting upon them.

After much deliberation, I’ve handed in my notice at Marshalls and begun setting myself up as a contractor. I have been mulling over the idea of going freelance for a long time, but have always had other distractions to worry about. Now that I’m married, settled in a new house, have obtained UK residency for Jocelyn, and baby Ben is settling down nicely, I figure that my life is finally getting to be stable and prosaic, and I should take this opportunity to stir things up a bit by handing in my notice with no certainty of regular (or indeed any) future income!

I am filled with a heady mixture of trepidation and excitement. More details will, undoubtedly, appear on this blog in due course. Wish me luck!
