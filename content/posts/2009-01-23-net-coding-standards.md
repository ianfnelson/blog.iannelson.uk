Sometimes, when you join a new team as a .NET developer, the team lead proudly points you in the direction of a Word document or wiki page detailing the teamâ€™s house coding standards.<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">

In my experience, these documents are invariably:

  * Incomplete.
  * Subjective.
  * Not enforced.
  * Largely copied from the interweb.
  * Obsessed with the trivial (e.g. whitespace) while failing to mention the genuinely useful (e.g. boxing/unboxing, avoiding use of deprecated classes, Dispose pattern, etc).

I know this because Iâ€™ve been involved in creating such documents in the past ðŸ™‚

Donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™m all in favour of creating clean code, and promoting standards within a team. I just find that most in-house style guides fail to achieve this, for the reasons listed above.

So, as I was walking through the city today, I started having a little debate with myself. &#8220;OK then, smarty-pants. Whatâ€™s your alternative? What would your in-house coding standards guidelines look like?&#8221;

I think it can be summarised by four simple points, listed in order of importance:

**1. Donâ€™t Ignore Compiler Warnings**

You might think this would be an obvious one, but Iâ€™ve lost count of the number of times Iâ€™ve retrieved a solution from source control, compiled it, and been presented with a list of compiler warnings. Most of the time, thereâ€™s no excuse for this. If the _compiler_ smells a rat in your code, then youâ€™ve got a problem, be it variables that are used without being initialized, unused variables, unreachable code, or whatever. Itâ€™s sloppy code, and itâ€™s easily avoided, so donâ€™t leave it for the next guy to clean up. I am, if you hadnâ€™t guessed, a big fan of setting the &#8220;treat compiler warnings as errors&#8221; flag in a projectâ€™s build properties.

**2. Follow the Framework Design Guidelines**

The [Framework Design Guidelines][1] is another one of those books whose name doesnâ€™t do it justice. The sagely guidance it contains is appropriate not only to Microsofties developing the FCL itself, but to anyone writing any .NET code. Donâ€™t let your developers near a copy of Visual Studio until theyâ€™ve provided a sworn affidavit confirming that theyâ€™ve read this book! ðŸ™‚

All of the guidelines are concisely boiled down into Do, Consider, Avoid, and Do Not recommendations, and you would do well to adhere to these. Getting a few copies of this book for your team is a much more effective and cost-effective approach than trying to develop your own coding standards.

**3. Run FxCop**

Having read and digested the Framework Design Guidelines, you need an easy way to enforce them. This is best achieved by running [FxCop][1] against your code (now integrated into some of the Visual Studio SKUs as a &#8220;Code Analysis&#8221; option).

Depending on the target audience for your solution, you may consider it reasonable to ignore some of the localization recommendations (i.e. when developing in-house line of business applications with limited geographical reach). But generally, if FxCop flags a warning in your code, I believe you would be well advised to correct the problem. Doing this helps to avoid a wide range of performance, security and design issues, in addition to enforcing consistent source code conventions.

**4. Run StyleCop**

Finally, if you simply must achieve that uniform source code appearance that the whitespace Nazis in every team strive for, consider requiring that your devs run their code through [StyleCop][2] before checking in. It may initially be a bit annoying, and for sure some of the recommendations are highly subjective, but thereâ€™s no arguing that it does enforce a standard style, with a strong focus on increasing readability and reducing ambiguity.

**And After That&#8230;?**

Following the four points above should result in the low-level codebase produced by a team being readable, of high quality, in a common style, and free of many common &#8220;gotchas&#8221;. It doesnâ€™t validate the higher-level architectural considerations, but in my opinion that is outside the scope of such a document, and could best be achieved through the use of a tool such as [NDepend][3]. But thatâ€™s a topic for another post&#8230;
