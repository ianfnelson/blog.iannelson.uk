I started my career in professional software development a decade or so ago by testing and fixing banking code that had fallen victim to the millennium bug.

Could the prospect of zero percent interest rates create a similar boom in demand for software developers?

From [Contractor UK][1]:

> Interest rates have plummeted from 5% to 2% since early October and are heading lower. Some analysts say 0% is not out of the question.
> 
> Imagine all the policy bounds checkers and field validation routines that need modifying to handle zero percent interest rates. The entire insurance industry will be clambering to find COBOL programmers able to understand 30 year old code and everybody else will benefit as demand escalates.
