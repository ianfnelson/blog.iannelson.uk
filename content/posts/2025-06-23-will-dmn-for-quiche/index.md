### _Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Embrace the Betweening_

When you're in between contracts, it's easy to feel like you're stuck in limbo. Professionally adrift, spiritually buffering, half-dressed in last Thursday's joggers. You refresh LinkedIn. You reword your bio again. You stare into the fridge like it's about to make you an offer.

Somewhere around day four, with no stand-ups to attend, no Jira tickets to nurture, and a growing sense that time had lost its formatting, I decided that the only rational move was to make a list of things to do.

Feel free to use it as a checklist, a comfort blanket, or a Rorschach test.

1. Alphabetise your spice rack. Add "Cumin Management" to your CV.

2. Bake scones. Eat them at 3:47pm. Pretend you're in a National Trust drama.

3. Annotate a page of _The Secret History_ like a Talmudic scholar.

20. Rebrand your consultancy as a cult. Design robes.

21. Submit a PR to OpenTelemetry titled "just vibe it".
