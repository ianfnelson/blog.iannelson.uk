Me: &#8220;Ben, I&#8217;m &#8216;Daddy&#8217; to you.&#8221;  
Ben (quizzically): &#8220;But you are &#8216;Ian&#8217; as well.&#8221;

I spent a good ten minutes this evening reading Isla a Ladybird book about Vikings. Their culture, food, tools where they came from, etc. The last page posed the question &#8220;What would you do if you were a Viking?&#8221;

Ben: &#8220;Hey Dad, in about three more birthdays you&#8217;ll be nearly 40&#8221;  
Me: &#8220;That&#8217;s right Ben. It&#8217;s a bit scary really.&#8221;  
Ben: &#8220;Yeah, and I know why you&#8217;re  
scared. &#8216;Cos you&#8217;ll be closer to dying.&#8221;

Isla shouted for me twice in the night, complaining that she was being plagued by &#8220;fairy bumblebees&#8221; that were trying to peel her skin off.  
During the day today, I quizzed her as to why she shouted for me and not Jocelyn Nelson.  
&#8220;Because you&#8217;re better at it,&#8221; she told me.  
&#8220;Better at what?&#8221; I asked.  
&#8220;Killing the fairy bumblebees!&#8221; she replied.

I went into Ben&#8217;s room to find that 21-month old Matthew had managed to climb up into Ben&#8217;s high-sleeper cabin bed.

&#8220;Matthew Henry, how did you get up there?!&#8221; I asked with mock exasperation.

He looked at me as if I were an imbecile, pointed and slowly said  
&#8220;Ladder!&#8221;

Saturday morning, 0645. It seems Matthew is slightly obsessed with the 90-second long theme tune at the end of contemporary Thomas The Tank Engine episodes.
