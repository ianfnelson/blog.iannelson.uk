Day Three &#8211; Beinn A&#8217;Chaorainn (3,550ft / 1,082m), Beinn Bhreac (3,054ft / 931m).

On which it rained a lot.  Lots of walking across boggy marshy stuff sprinkled with deer and sheep crap.  Another metaphor for life, then.<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">

I&#8217;ve never been so glad to see Richard&#8217;s Volvo, and I&#8217;ve don&#8217;t remember ever doing anything so exhausting.  Thankfully we&#8217;d already decided that Thursday would be a rest day.

We went to a pub in the evening, and the millennium came up in conversation again.  But instead of looking forward, we were trying to work out what has defined the mood of the &#8217;90s, the _zeitgeist_ of this decade.  But we couldn&#8217;t think of anything general, just a whole heap of one-off news events, celebrities, sporting events, and pop scenes with no real socio-cultural change beneath them.  With under 460 days left of the 1990&#8217;s, I can&#8217;t see that situation changing, either.  Hey ho.  &#8220;The transitional nineties&#8221;, then.
