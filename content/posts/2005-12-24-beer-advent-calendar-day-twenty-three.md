The penultimate beer on my 2005 advent calendar was [Ruby Red][1] from the [St. Peter&#8217;s Brewery][2] in Suffolk.  I&#8217;d been looking forward to this 4.3% ABV red ale, which, like all of the beers from St. Peter&#8217;s, comes in a distinctive flask-shaped oval bottle, so I was somewhat disappointed by the intense bitterness of the first few mouthfuls.  However, I think this was mostly due to the effects of the Mexican dinner laced with [Encona sauces][3] that I&#8217;d scoffed a few minutes previously.  Further into the bottle, the &#8220;subtle malt undertones and spicy aroma&#8221; became more apparent, and overall I really enjoyed this beer &#8211; I&#8217;ll definitely be trying some of the others from the range.
