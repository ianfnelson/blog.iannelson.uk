Gadzooks!  Who would have thought that it would be so difficult to find a few minutes each day to transcribe a few words about a bottle of beer?  But it is &#8211; especially as we enter the party season and my evenings are filled with festivities.

The good news is, I have three excellent beers to report on; the first two of which are from breweries that I&#8217;ve already &#8220;visited&#8221; during this advent calendar.

Tuesday&#8217;s beer was Bitter & Twisted, from the Harviestoun Brewery (c.f. [Schiehallion][1] on day three).  At 4.2% ABV it&#8217;s a little lighter than Schiehallion, but it&#8217;s equally delicious &#8211; very fresh, sharp and hoppy, it was voted Champion Bottled Ale 2004.  Mmmmm.

Wednesday I came back closer to home for a second beer from the [Hambleton Ales][2] microbrewery in Thirsk &#8211; this time it was Festive Filly (ABV 4.5%), which is presumably a seasonal ale, and damn nice it is too.  Another good winter warming beer.

Finally, today I enjoyed Nessie&#8217;s Monster Mash, a 4.4% &#8220;premium beer&#8221; from the [Cairngorm Brewery Company][3].  Very pleasant, plenty of flavour &#8211; I&#8217;d be interested in trying the cask version of this for comparison.

So there we have it, a trio of mighty fine ales from northern Britain, any one of which I&#8217;d love to have for a second time.  Aaah, this beer advent calendar was \*such\* a good idea&#8230;
