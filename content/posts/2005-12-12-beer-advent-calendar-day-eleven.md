I just realised that I forgot to blog about yesterday&#8217;s advent beer.  Sorry for keeping you all on tenterhooks like that!

To be honest I was a bit disappointed and couldn&#8217;t think of anything interesting to say about [Rudolph&#8217;s Revenge][1], a 4.6% ABV bitter from Cropton Brewery.  It was quite similar to the equally uninspiring [Mars Magic][2] from last Thursday.
