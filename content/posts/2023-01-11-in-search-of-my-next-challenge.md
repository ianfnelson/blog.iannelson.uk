Folks, this is your lucky day — Ian Nelson is back on the market.

After an unprecedented _five years_ working the same gig, I will be available for shiny new contract roles from February 2023 _(edit: now April 2023, thanks to a short extension)_.

## What I&#8217;ve Been Doing Recently {#what-ive-been-doing-recently.wp-block-heading}

Since March 2018 I&#8217;ve been a Technical Lead for the [NHS App][2], an England-wide way to access a range of NHS services via smartphone, tablet, and desktop web browser. It has been an amazing project to be a part of, and I&#8217;ve loved working in an open, collaborative, and agile delivery environment alongside a bunch of clever people from NHS Digital, Kainos, and BJSS.

I&#8217;ve led an ever-changing, multi-disciplinary team through over 120 fortnightly sprints — a period that saw the App&#8217;s user base grow from nothing to over thirty million users, and become the most downloaded app in the App Store during the COVID-19 pandemic years.

I&#8217;ve led the design and development of the App&#8217;s notification and messaging capability, which allows the secure and sub second delivery of health-related communications from NHS organisations to patient&#8217;s mobile devices, replacing more costly communication methods such as SMS or mail.

In case it&#8217;s not obvious, I&#8217;m pretty proud of what we&#8217;ve achieved on the NHS App over the past five years, and could write much more. But I&#8217;ll save that for a future blog post and return to the sales pitch&#8230;

## What I Do Generally {#what-i-do-generally.wp-block-heading}

I am a hands-on Technical Architect / Technical Lead. I draw boxes and arrows on (real and virtual) whiteboards, and talk about those designs with teams, allowing us to collaboratively bring maintainable, performant and scalable solutions into existence.

I am detail-oriented and still a developer at heart. I like to stay close to the codebase. I am not an [Architecture Astronaut][3]. I prefer developing backend code to frontend. I am comfortable taking ownership of systems and communicating with people at all levels of an organisation.

## The Technology I Use {#the-technology-i-use.wp-block-heading}

I have over 20 years&#8217; experience of C# and .NET development, from the betas through to C#10 and .NET Core 6.0 (but I still have to occasionally Google how to properly implement the IDisposable pattern).

I have been working with Azure products for, gosh, it must be over a decade now. I have spent significant time wrangling with App Services, Function Apps, Cosmos DB (Mongo and (No)SQL), Event Hubs, SQL Database, Kubernetes Service and Service Bus. I have found and reported a bug to the Notification Hub product team, and been mailed a t-shirt by the Cognitive Search team in response to my feedback.

I favour distributed architectures that are loosely-connected by messaging patterns and RESTful APIs. I am vaguely suspicious of the rush towards Microservices. I am a bit disappointed that the end of the relational database hegemony means that I no longer get to use my SQL skills on a daily basis, but have replaced this with a new-found admiration for Splunk queries.

## How I Work {#how-i-work.wp-block-heading}

I prefer to code in the open and work in the open. I favour public Slack channels over DMs. I appreciate the DevOps culture where all members of the team are empowered to make changes to a collective codebase. I think infrastructure as code is one of the game-changing trends of the last decade.

I still quite like Test-Driven Development, but am learning to be more pragmatic about when it is applied, and when to use chunkier integration tests.

I am a Microsoft Registered Partner, but do all my work on a MacBook.

I care very much about the quality of the solutions that I help to create, but I try to inject levity and humour into the working day, and do not take myself too seriously.

I like to break up lengthy blog posts with photos of my dog.

## More Randomness {#more-randomness.wp-block-heading}

My favourite software books of all time include _[Working Effectively with Legacy Code][4], [Domain-Driven Design][5],_ and _[Release It][6]!_ 

My favourite GoF design patterns are Visitor and Chain of Responsibility.

Some people that I&#8217;ve worked with have written nice things about me, and I didn&#8217;t even have to pay them. You can read a collection of these endorsements on my [testimonials page][7].

## Sound Good? {#sound-good.wp-block-heading}

I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed reading these insights into my psyche and skills. If you&#8217;d like to know more, or think that I might be able to help you, then let&#8217;s talk. You can [download my CV here][1], and email me at <ian@iannelson.systems>.
