A return to form today, with the vase of fate serving up a helping of Riggwelter, the [Black Sheep Breweryâ€™s][1] delicious 4.7% strong Yorkshire ale. &nbsp;I could drink this till the cows come home. &nbsp;Or perhaps that should be the sheep, for (according to the bottle) the name Riggwelter comes from the Old Norse _rygg_ meaning to overturn. &nbsp;&#8220;When a sheep is on its back and cannot get up without help, local dales dialect says itâ€™s _rigged_ or _riggwelted_.&#8221;

Jocelyn says: &#8220;Thatâ€™s cheating, youâ€™ve had that one before, youâ€™re supposed to be trying something new. &nbsp;Iâ€™m not interested&#8221;.

She speaks the truth, this isnâ€™t exactly my first Riggwelter. &nbsp;In fact Iâ€™ve taken Joce to visit the brewery in Masham before ðŸ™‚
