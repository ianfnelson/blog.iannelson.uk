A return to form today, with the vase of fate serving up a helping of Riggwelter, the [Black Sheep Brewery’s][1] delicious 4.7% strong Yorkshire ale. &nbsp;I could drink this till the cows come home. &nbsp;Or perhaps that should be the sheep, for (according to the bottle) the name Riggwelter comes from the Old Norse _rygg_ meaning to overturn. &nbsp;“When a sheep is on its back and cannot get up without help, local dales dialect says it’s _rigged_ or _riggwelted_.”

Jocelyn says: “That’s cheating, you’ve had that one before, you’re supposed to be trying something new. &nbsp;I’m not interested”.

She speaks the truth, this isn’t exactly my first Riggwelter. &nbsp;In fact I’ve taken Joce to visit the brewery in Masham before 🙂
