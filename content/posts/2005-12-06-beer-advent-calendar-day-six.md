A return to form today, with the vase of fate serving up a helping of Riggwelter, the [Black Sheep Brewery&#8217;s][1] delicious 4.7% strong Yorkshire ale. &nbsp;I could drink this till the cows come home. &nbsp;Or perhaps that should be the sheep, for (according to the bottle) the name Riggwelter comes from the Old Norse _rygg_ meaning to overturn. &nbsp;&#8220;When a sheep is on its back and cannot get up without help, local dales dialect says it&#8217;s _rigged_ or _riggwelted_.&#8221;

Jocelyn says: &#8220;That&#8217;s cheating, you&#8217;ve had that one before, you&#8217;re supposed to be trying something new. &nbsp;I&#8217;m not interested&#8221;.

She speaks the truth, this isn&#8217;t exactly my first Riggwelter. &nbsp;In fact I&#8217;ve taken Joce to visit the brewery in Masham before ðŸ™‚
