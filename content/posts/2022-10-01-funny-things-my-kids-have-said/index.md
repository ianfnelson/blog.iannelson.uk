I spent a good ten minutes this evening reading Isla a Ladybird book about Vikings. Their culture, food, tools where they came from, etc. The last page posed the question “What would you do if you were a Viking?”

Ben: “Hey Dad, in about three more birthdays you’ll be nearly 40”  
Me: “That’s right Ben. It’s a bit scary really.”

Isla: “Pooing on your head.”  
Me: “O-K… any ideas where you would like me to take you today?”

Isla shouted for me twice in the night, complaining that she was being plagued by “fairy bumblebees” that were trying to peel her skin off.  
During the day today, I quizzed her as to why she shouted for me and not Jocelyn Nelson.

“Better at what?” I asked.  
“Killing the fairy bumblebees!” she replied.

Ben’s homework – think of ten verbs and write sentences containing them.

I went into Ben’s room to find that 21-month old Matthew had managed to climb up into Ben’s high-sleeper cabin bed.

“Matthew Henry, how did you get up there?!” I asked with mock exasperation.

He looked at me as if I were an imbecile, pointed and slowly said  
“Ladder!”

When the broken printer that I offered on FreeCycle failed to garner any interest:

Ben: “Ah Dad, why don’t you say how good it

One week in to our vacation, Isla’s Spanish is still somewhat lacking.

Saturday morning, 0645. It seems Matthew is slightly obsessed with the 90-second long theme tune at the end of contemporary Thomas The Tank Engine episodes.

“Dadda, more choo-choo! Song! Crew!” (Hits me with remote control)

At home we keep a bunch of Thomas The Tank Engine track inside a large footstool. Here’s a photo of a frustrated Matthew discovering that not all footstools in the universe possess this property. “Track!!!”

Me: “Isla, your bagel is ready!”  
Matthew runs into the kitchen.  
Me: “You’re not Isla. You’re Matthew.”  
Isla walks into the kitchen.
