Halfway through my great beer advent calendar 2005, and tonight I&#8217;ve enjoyed the popular Leffe Blonde, a potent and delicious 6.6% ABV beer from Belgium.  I&#8217;ve been meaning to try this reknowned tipple since I utterly failed to identify a snippet of the label in one of those irritating Excel-based quizzes that circulates on the interweb periodically.  Anyway, I wasn&#8217;t disappointed &#8211; the small bottle size (33cl) being more than made up for by the strength and the flavour (quite almondy, I thought).  There&#8217;s a good detailed review by someone with more effective taste buds than I over at the excellent [Oxford Bottled Beer Database][1].
