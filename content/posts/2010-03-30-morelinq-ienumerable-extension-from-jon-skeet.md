I’ve just become aware of this [MoreLINQ][1] project containing some neat IEnumerable extensions authored by the inimitable [Jon Skeet][2].

I particularly like the look of [DistinctBy][3] – that’s gotta be a lot easier than passing custom instances of IEqualityComparer into Distinct().

Fun fact – I used to work with someone who went to school with Jon Skeet! True Story!
