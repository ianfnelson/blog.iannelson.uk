Another day, another beer. &nbsp;It’s a hard life. &nbsp;[Mars Magic][1] is a rather unexciting 4.6% ABV &#8220;Premium Ale&#8221; (it says here) from the [Wold Top Brewery][2]. &nbsp;Noticeably lacking in anything resembling a head, it did however seem to improve as I progressed through the half-litre (funny how that happens). &nbsp;So, with my whistle well and truly whetted, I’m off down [the pub][3]. &nbsp;Cya!

Oh, I nearly forgot to record Joce’s comments on the bitter. &nbsp;It went something like: &#8220;Eurgh!&#8221;
