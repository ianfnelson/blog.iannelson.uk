Friday night saw me out celebrating in Halifax at our departmental Christmas meal (FWIW, I drank a few pints of Santa&#8217;s Little Helper from the [Caledonian brewery][1]).  As a result, I didn&#8217;t get chance to enjoy my advent beer, and have been playing catch-up with a couple of randomly-selected bottles tonight.

Firstly, the sixteenth beer to be selected from the vase of fate was Delirium Nocturnum, a **9.0%** ABV dark ale from the Huyghe-Melle brewery in Belgium which comes in silver glittery 330ml bottles featuring pictures of pink elephants.  I was somewhat apprehensive, but needlessly so, as this is a surprisingly well-balanced and hoppy triply-fermented ale &#8211; not a novelty drink at all (despite the packaging being somewhat reminiscent of a Pizza Express salad dressing bottle).

Secondly, today&#8217;s drink was Rolling Hitch, a 5.2% ABV India pale ale from the [Darwin Brewery][2] in Sunderland.  This was specially created for the purposes of entering (and winning) a competition to supply all Asda stores.  It&#8217;s fruity, sharp, bitter and hoppy &#8211; very enjoyable.  
Oh, and in case you were wondering,a quick [Googling][3] reveals that a Rolling Hitch is a seafaring knot &#8211; [_&#8220;if a jib sheet jams in a winch, you can attach a rolling hitch to take the pressure off the line as you undo the jam&#8221;_][4] &#8211; so now you know.
