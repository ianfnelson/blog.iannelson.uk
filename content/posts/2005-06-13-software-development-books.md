Elizabeth Keogh has been blogging her [advice for software-developer apprentices][1], and recommends buying and reading a selection of good software development books. I think this is sound advice – personally I felt that my career and abilities starting taking off when I stopped reading tech-specific Wrox tomes that were obsolete within six months of publication and started buying timeless Addison-Wesley hardbacks. Why so many newbie coders insist on rediscovering solutions to well-known problems instead of leveraging the knowledge of our programming forebears is beyond me, but most of us have behaved in this way at some point. Give yourself a leg-up and read some decent software design books.

If I had to make a list, the books I would currently prescribe for new graduates entering a career of enterprise OO development would be:

  1. [_Code Complete_][2]
  2. [_Domain Driven Design_][3]
  3. [_Refactoring_][4]
  4. [_Design Patterns_][5]
  5. [_Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture_][6]

and if I was feeling cynical I’d perhaps also advise a copy of [_The Career Programmer – Guerilla Tactics for an Imperfect World_][7] be kept stashed in a laptop bag&#8230;
